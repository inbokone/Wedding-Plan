[Congratulations. MAME]

00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,060
[What do you think a wedding is made of?]

4
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,390
[Flowers that that make you feel like you're in a fairy tale.]

5
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,490
[Impressively delicious food.]

6
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,470
The couple finally got married.

7
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,360
Yes, I can't believe this day really came.
[The guests' wishes to the bride and groom.]

Their parents supported them too.

9
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,500
They finally defeated us.

10
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,500
Yeah.

11
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,150
Then you must give me a bigger wedding than Sky.

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,180
[Best friends.]

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,010
[Of course, the bride and the groom are the most important.]

14
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,050
I love you.

15
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:27,820
Not only do I like the look of you,

16
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,650
but also the time I spent with you.

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,190
[But sometimes when it comes to another groom...]

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,759
I love you.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,820
Not only do I love your success,

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,800
but also you made me a better person. So I love you.

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,910
I love you, Sky.

[And family, souvenirs, flowers, receptionists, the MC, and coordinators.]

23
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,830
[There are more. It's impossible to list them all in one day.]

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,290
I love you too.

25

[The most important thing to me is]

[the love between the bride and groom.]

27
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,960

[Where are you?]

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,130
[You're always like this at the weddings we organized.]

33

[Where is the surprise gift Pai prepared?]

34
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,220
[The MC is also looking for you. Come to the back now.]

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,650
Give me 30 seconds. I'll be right there.

36
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,230
[You only have 15 seconds. Come here quickly.]

37
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,970
Okay, I'll be right there.

38

Hey, J'Im.

[Where have you been eating voraciously again?]

43
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,000
[Do you remember we're meeting a client this afternoon?]

44
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,240
Eating voraciously? J'Im. You're not being nice.

45
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,500
[One day, you'll die from overeating.]

46
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,020
[When are you coming back?]

47
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,370
About half an hour. I'll eat a little longer.

48
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,680
[Okay, don't be late.]

49
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,160
[There's a big client this afternoon. I'll emphasize it again. He's a big client.]

50
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,040
Okay, J'Im.

51
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,290
Die from overeating?

52
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,030
At least, I'll die in happiness.

53
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,360
A big client?

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,460
I hope they are as kind as Pai and Sky.

55
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,240
But I really had enough with rich women.

56
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,540
Just let it be. It's time to please my eyes.

How embarrassing.

72
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,350
Your perfect ideal man is right behind you. How come you didn't see him?

73
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,800
[It's rare to see a man with a handsome face, a hot body and broad shoulders.]

[He must also have a big...]

[I mean the muscles on his arms.]

I knew it.

Today's quotation: there are two types of good men.

80
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,350
Either he has a girlfriend or

81
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,590
a boyfriend.

Nuea, what's wrong?

86
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,170
Im.

87
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,400
How dare you call her lady boss without honorifics?

88
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,990
Aren't you afraid she'll get mad?

89
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,470
No, it's not that I didn't use honorifics. J'Im.

90
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,600
I mean I'm full.

91

Fine.

92
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,450
What are you doing, J'Im?

93
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,800
Did you eat fast food again?

94
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,160
Yes, why?

95
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,010
Nuea, although you're thin, your belly is getting bigger.

96
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,980
This is called mellow and full.

97
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,700
It's nice. It makes me feel warm.

98
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,040
Also, I may not be as thin as you. But I can always find the man I want.

No.

J'Im is just jealous of me.

106
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,540
I've been single for over a year,

107
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,130
because I've been working.

108
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,080
If a good man shows up in front of me, I won't let him go.

He's a nice guy.

[Yes, I do want him.]

No.

125
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,120
Yiwa is my bride.

126

[If I say God is cruel, is it too rude?]

127
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,790
[Because this is...]

[We will help realize your dream.]

129
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,370
As we discussed on the phone,

130
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,840
the wedding is in three months, right? Ms. Yiwa?

131
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,930
Yes.

132
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,920
Then, we don't have much time.

133
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,430
You can't do it?

134
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,130
It's not that.

135
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,370
We only have three months.

136
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,850
The preparation of Mr. Sailom and Ms. Yiwa's wedding may be a bit hasty.

137
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,550
The bride and groom will be very tired.

138
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,280
That's why we're here.

139
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,090
Everyone says your company's is "We will help realize your dream".

140
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:37,040
That's why we chose you to hold the wedding ceremony for us in three months.

141
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,850
In a way we can't.

142
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,510
But it sounds like you're implying that you can't do it.

143
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,000
I didn't say we can't.

144
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,900
Mr. Sailom. I apologize for any misunderstanding I may have caused.

145
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,800
Okay, Lom, stop teasing Nuea.

146
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,160
I'm not.

147
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,860
We are all watching.

148
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,140
This is bad, Lom.

149
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,600
Two-faced man.

150
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,620
What did you just say?

151
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,880
No. J'Im, did you hear anyone saying anything?

152
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,200
No.

153
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,360
-No.
-Right. No.

154
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,240
I saw Nuea staring at my bride.

155
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,270
That's why I asked you.

156
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,250
I didn't.

157
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,350
What I want to say is

158
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,870
I think Ms. Yiwa will look pretty in a wedding dress.

159
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,020
Right, J'Im?

160
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,530
Yes.

161
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,240
See? I told you.

162
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,640
But I...

163
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,940
Have you decided on a wedding venue?

164
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,290
Em.

165
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,730

Mr. Lom, what about you?

I haven't thought about it yet.

Let me tell you from my experience.

171
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,430
It may be hard for your parents to cooperate.

172
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,250
I can promise you. Our parents won't interfere.

173

Yes.

174

180
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,440
About 500.

181

Okay.

182
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,710
You look like you have something to say.

183
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,790
Oh, it's nothing. Mr. Lom, have you ever seen

No.

186

They might appear at the wedding.

187
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,230
I suggest you prepare for more guests.

188
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,440
Just in case.

Will they really get married, J'Im?

199

Stop complaining and don't forget that clients are God.

You can ask Lom.

I didn't. Why should I force myself to face that jerk?

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,400
Two.

329
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,290
Push harder.

330
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,550
Don't give up. Keep going.

331
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,930
I can't stand it anymore.

332
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,300
He blocked the fitness instructor's number.

333
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,340
Why?

334
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,550
He only ran on the treadmill for half an hour.

335
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,680
But he kept complaining that the instructor wanted to kill him.

336
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,200
So...

337
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,920
I don't know. How did Lom find out that I hate gyms?

338
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,500
It's a coincidence.

339
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,760
Whether it's a coincidence or not, he annoys me.

340
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,800
So, what are you going to do next?

341
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,540
Since he challenged us, we'll fight back.

342
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,820
No one can damage our company's reputation, right?

343
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,230
I don't give up easily.

344
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,780
If we fall into a dead end with him,

345
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,290
we can only go to the other source of information.

346
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,050
Good idea.

347
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
You're smart.

348
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,730
Remember what I said.

349
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,700
I will hold a wedding of the century for that darn groom.

350
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,870
If it's about the wedding, you should ask Lom.

351
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,350
Why?

352
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I'm really sorry. Our meeting wasted your time.

353
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:20,370
But you should talk to Lom about the details. I've left all the decisions to him.

354
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:26,030
Ms. Yiwa. Don't you have any specific ideas or concepts about your wedding?

355
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,410
For example, the reception type, theme or color scheme.

356
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,370
Now, using a single color on wedding items has become a fashion.

357
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,270
For example, souvenirs, return gifts, and invitations

358
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,190
are usually designed in one color.

359
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,820
Ms. Yiwa, please take a look at these samples.

360
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,890
It's so hard.

361
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,970
When I was in school,

362
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,470
I couldn't even come up with a theme for the farewell party.

363
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,470
But,

364
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,980
it's also pretty with lots of flowers like this.

365
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,710
What about the venue?

366
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,950
I emailed you a list of nice wedding venues.

367
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,420
Did you read it?

368
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,590
I like hotels near my house.

369
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,360
I saw one on the list you sent me.

370
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,530
Let's check the location and book it as soon as possible, okay?

371
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,820
But I'm not sure if Lom will like it.

372
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,400
How about this? Nuea, why don't you go there with Lom?

373
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,900
Is it okay to leave all the decisions to the groom?

374
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,520
Sorry, I crossed the line.

375
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,680
It's nothing.

376
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,170
I can only answer your questions with...

377
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,230
Good.

378
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,650
You mean you're okay with the groom picking out a wedding dress?

379
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,320
I'm satisfied with everything Lom chooses.

380
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,450
But this is also an important day for the bride.

381
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,710
Just let Lom decide.

382
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,480
What if the wedding doesn't go well?

383
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,060
Even so, I'll still listen to Lom.

384
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,950
For this wedding,

385
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,810
it's all up to Lom.

386
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,880
[It's all up to Lom.]

387
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,130
Hey, what's wrong?

388
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,190
[Don't talk to me in your sweet voice.]

389
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,560
[Lom. Don't tease Nuea anymore. I feel bad for him.]

390
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,710
Who teased him?

391
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,850
[How long are you going to tease him?]

392
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,080
[I just told him it's all up to you.]

393
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,160
[Anyway, don't forget to contact Nuea.]

394
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,960
[He must be crying now.]

395
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,660
I don't think he's a crybaby.

396
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,550
[Anyway, don't forget to contact him.]

397
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,920
Yes, madam.

398
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,620
What day is it today?

399
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,780
We don't have a specific number of guests yet.

400
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,510
We don't have a venue either.

401
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,700
The bride and groom are too busy.

402
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,500
The details of the ceremony in the morning are not clear either.

403
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,080
The theme of the evening party is still uncertain.

404
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,800
The bride and groom don't have time to try on dresses or suits.

405
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,070
We haven't filmed the wedding photos, and we haven't even made the invitations.

406
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,750
It takes about 20 days to customize the wedding gifts.

407
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,570
Let alone the makeup artist, the hairstylist, and the photographer.

408
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,500
Nuea, are you still alive?

409
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,429
J'Im. Are they really getting married?

410
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,610
It is their wedding, not mine.

411
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:41,580
Wedding planners can't read people's preferences like a psychic.

412
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,440
Why can't they just tell me what they want?

413
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,830
Only after that can I realize it?

414
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,020
Okay.

415
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,380
[Are you free to meet tonight?]

416
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,010
[I've figured out the wedding I want.]

417
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,460
Yes, I'm very free.

418
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,500
Nuea, did he ask you to meet him at the gym again?

419
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,390
Not bad.

420
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,270
You can finally overcome your resistance towards a healthy lifestyle.

421
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,080
So, you have to get a gym membership to deal with Mr. Lom.

422
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,400
You have to do it.

423
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,850
Do we have the budget?

424
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,730
Are you daydreaming?

425
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,330
Wake up.

426
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:31,660
Why should I spend thousands of dollars to become a gym member for a stranger's wedding?

427
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,020
That's impossible.

428
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,570
I'm leaving.

429
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,570
Don't mess it up.

430
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,540
I came to discuss the wedding with you as we agreed.

431
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,050
Hold on.

432
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,500
Let me finish this first.

433
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,960
Hello, Mr. Nuea.

434
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,830
Are you the planner for Sailom's wedding?

435
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,960
Yes.

436
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,150
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

437
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,560
It's okay.

438
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,980
By the way, are you interested in working out at our gym?

439
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,920
It's good for your health.

440
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,470
It not only helps strengthen your muscles,

441
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,950
but can also make you stronger.

442
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:56,070
Mr. Nuea, you're very thin.

443
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,270
I'm sorry.

444
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,250
Sorry, I want to discuss the details of the wedding as soon as possible.

445
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,970
I'll be back soon.

446
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,610
This way, Nuea.

447
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,660
Lom.

448
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,370
Mr. Lom.

449
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,740
Nuea. You look perfect now.

450
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,140
Don't listen to others.

451
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,210
Mr. Lom, your hand...

452
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,980
Sorry.

453
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,790
You looked very uncomfortable just now.

454
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,890
A little. Thank you for helping me.

455
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,000
It's cold.

456
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,300
I mean your hand.

457
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,850
Your hands are still cold after the exercise.

458
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,750
My hands are cold.

459
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,480
Oh, right. I already talked to Ms. Yiwa about the hotel.

460
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,890
She really likes the hotels near her house, because it's closer.

461
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,990
If you're interested, I can arrange a time to visit these hotels.

462
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,030
You only think about work.

463
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,960
When the client refuses to cooperate, that's all I can do.

464
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,090
Are you saying I refused to cooperate?

465
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,760
I think I did my best.

466
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,070
Then... Which hotel do you think is a good choice?

467
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,160
The first one.

468
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:39,230
Apart from being closer, the reception hall is suitable for many themes.

469
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,130
The stage is perfect for the wedding cake.

470
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,280
The entrance just needs a few beautiful flowers

471
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,880
to make it look amazing!

472
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,950
Let's do as you say. You decide.

473
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,270
Aren't you going to compare these two hotels with your budget?

474
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,670
No.

475
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,010
I trust you.

476
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,440
What's that expression? I'm serious.

477
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,890
I believe you are good at your job.

478
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,500
Thank you for your trust.

479
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,830
I will make this wedding unforgettable.

480
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,550
Yes. I also believe it will be very unforgettable.

481
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,280
Follow me.

482
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,350
I'll bring you the files.

483
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,770
Nuea, the files are in the locker.

484
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,500
I was going to e-mail it to you.

485
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,700
[I hope someone can bump me into his back.]

486
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,570
[I won't ask for anything else for the whole week.]

487
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,890
-Darn it.
-Nuea.

488
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,170
Are you okay?

489
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,410
I'm fine.

490
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,160
-Let me see your back.
-I said I'm fine.

491
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,570
-Let me see.
-It's really okay, Lom.

492
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,780
Are you really okay?

493
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,120
Can you hold on?

494
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,430
Yes.

495
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,860
How did you hit your back on the locker?

496
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,440
It's all your fault.

497
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,150
Me?

498
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,250
Is it really because of me?

499
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,070
Lom. What are you doing?

500
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,580
Is it really because of me?

501
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,580
What are you doing, Lom?

502
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,050
Don't forget we're in the gym.

503
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,030
Lom, what are you doing?

504
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,880
These are the files.

505
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,680
What did you say about the gym?

506
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,690
Nothing.

507
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,420
-Really? But I'm sure I heard it.
-It's really nothing.

508
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:34,290
You're going to change, right? I'll wait for you outside.

509
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,350
Who said he hates exercises?

510
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,820
He runs fast.

511
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,080
It was the same then.

512
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,350
What are you looking at?

513
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,800
Pai, who is that?

514
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,590
Oh, his name is Nuea. He's my wedding planner.

515
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:18,740
Why?

516
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,480
It's nothing. I just think he works very hard.

517
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,910
Of course.

518
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,570
Look at my wedding.

519
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,600
I'm very satisfied.

520
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,540
You know what?

521
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,510
When he planned our wedding, Sky and I were completely stumped.

522
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,460
But when Nuea heard us out, he understood our ideas completely.

523
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,570
Why? Are you marrying Yiwa?

524
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,000
It's about time.

525
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,640
Let me introduce him to you.

526
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,900
-I'll take care of the guests.
-Okay.

527
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,790
If you like him, pursue him. Don't always make him angry.

528
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,990
We're getting married. How can I pursue someone else?

529
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,080
It's okay. The bride has agreed.

530
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,320
After all, I'm the only one who can be your bride.

531
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,240
Am I right?

532
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,420
You're so confident.

533
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,650
Lom.

534
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,500
You didn't deny something just now.

535
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,640
What is it?

536
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,060
The fact that you like Nuea.

537
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,780
Go after him if you like him.

538
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,170
If you like him, do it. I'll support you.

539
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,360
The problem is

540
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,240
the groom and the wedding planner sound impossible.

541
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:10,770
Are you sure? I'll wait and see.

542
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,430
What do you mean the bride can't come?

543
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,560
[In the next episode]

544
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,390
I told you Yiwa would come.

545
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,610
[No one said that it's wrong to have a crush on the groom.]

546
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,310
[It's just a kind of tremor. It's okay.]

547
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,060
[Today, I'm really sick of these wedding matters.]

548
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:35,990
[Whenever something bothers me, I'll come here for some fresh air.]

549
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,460
[All my worries seem to disappear here.]

550
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,240
[You said you wanted to know me.]

551
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,610
Me too.
