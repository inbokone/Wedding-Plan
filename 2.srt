Don't forget that we're at the gym.

What's up with you? You didn't react when I poked or called you.

Nothing.

Oh please, why are you lying about it? Do you expect us to believe that?

33
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,110
You ordered wrong color of flowers the other day.

34
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,710
You gave the tea ceremony details to the couple

35

who wanted the water sprinkling ceremony.

36

And you sent the wrong information to clients.

37
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,190
They complained about

38
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,110

Didn't you also order the wrong flowers?

47
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,230
I'm so tired. Let's get back to work. Is this right?

66

The bride. Where's Yiwa?

67
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,600
You think you're going to find her there?

68
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,310
Yiwa didn't come with me. I came alone to pick you up.

Yiwa will join us at the boutique later, right?

70

Come sit in the front.

71
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,160
Or do you want me to be your chauffeur while you relax in the back?

72
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,550
No, of course not. I wouldn't dare to do that.

73
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,350
Actually, you didn't have to come and pick me up.

74
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,350
We can just meet at the boutique.

75
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,120
I feel bad for having you come all the way here.

76
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,590
You can repay me if you feel bad.

77
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,870
What do you want me to do?

78
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,670
Have you had breakfast yet?

79
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,390
I had a small bite.

80
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,040
That's good. Let's go or we'll be late.

81

What do you want to eat?

83
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,470
I'd like a sausage McMuffin set.

84
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,680
Two sausage McMuffin sets, please.

85
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,790
I'll take the set with an extra egg, and with a large soft drink.

86
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,030
For the first set, please add an egg and swap to a large soft drink.

87
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,630
For the other set, I'll have a coffee.

88
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,110
Do you want anything else?

89
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,600
No, I have a small appetite.

90
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,950
Yes, I believe so.

91
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,600
How much do I owe for my food?

92
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,680
It's on me.

93
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,270
That's not right. I can't let a client pay for me.

94
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,310
I'm the one who forced you to have breakfast with me.

95
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,670
Besides, I said I wanted you to repay me.

96
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,230
Consider this a chance to do so.

97
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,430
Repay you? What are you talking about?

98
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,470
If I had known what was coming,

99
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,590
I would have asked to pay for the food ten times over.

100
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,680
Nuea. Please keep your hand steady. I can't reach it.

101
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,030
[Calm down, Nuea. Calm down.]

102
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,710
[Keep calm and win over...]

103
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,110
[How on earth can I stay calm?]

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,040
Oh!

105
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,590
I'm sorry, Lom! Is it hot?

106
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,150
It's okay. My pants are thick.

107
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,520
But they are all messy. You should clean it right away.

108
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,350
It'll be hard to clean if you leave a stain.

109
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,160
Nuea!

110
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,960
I'm really fine.

111
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,750
But I won't be if you don't stop.

112
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm sorry, Lom. Are you hurt?

113
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm fine. I'm the one who should apologize.

114
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,640
But...

115
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,750
If you really feel guilty, please feed me properly.

116
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,710
I can't handle hot stuff well.

117
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,390
I don't think I should.

118
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,230
Ouch!

119
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,470
Will it leave a scar?

120
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,150
It hurts so bad.

121
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,760
Nuea. You have a hard skull.

122
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,350
Fine, but just this once.

123
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,870
My bad, I was so focused on the road that I bit the wrong thing.

124
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,870
It's okay.

125
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,910
[It's not okay at all!]

126
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,170
[This groom is clearly flirting with me.]

127
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,360
[I'd become a monk if I could remain calm.]

128
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,910
[Pull yourself together, Nuea.]

129
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,710
Let's finish it up. You're almost done.

130
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,590
Swallow it.

131
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,040
One more bite.

132
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,880
-Is it good?
-Nuea.

133
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,990
-Keep eating.
-Please stop.

134
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,110
Hurry up and finish it.

135
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,830
Wait, Nuea.

136
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,070
What are you doing?

137
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,440
Lom, you shouldn't do this.

138
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,110
Are you going to...

139
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,230
I was going to tell you that you had sauce on your lips.

140
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,190
See?

141
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,880
Were you saying something about what I shouldn't do?

142
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,630
I was going to tell you that I couldn't handle cold stuff well.

143
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,750
That's right, and your hand is ice-cold like you've been holding it against the AC.

144
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,910
That's why I was startled.

145
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,790
I'll let the boutique staff know that we've arrived.

146
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,070
Lom. Please join me as soon as you can.

147
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
Okay.

148
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,160
Okay.

149
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,120
Nuea's quote of the day:

150
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,990
No one ever said it was wrong to have a crush on a groom.

151
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,550
It's just a flutter.

152
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,110
You'll be fine.

153
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
Stop shaking.

154
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,070
[Have a great day, Lom.]

155
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,070
[Yiwa]

156
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,830
Thank you for that.

157
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,790
You're out of your mind, Lom.

158
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,710
Looks like Mr. Groom is quite happy.

159
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,160
Marine.

160
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,110
Marine.

161
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,400
Are you mad at me?

162
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,590
No.

163
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,190
But...

164
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,150
Marine's girlfriend is getting married.

165
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,750
Will you be happy when your girlfriend is marrying someone else?

166
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,350
You only have eyes for another man.

167
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,040
Come on, Lom isn't just anyone else.

168
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,550
You know that even if it's Lom, even if he knows about us.

169
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,550
How can I be happy about it?

170
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,870
I want to see you in a wedding dress.

171
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,470
But not like this.

172
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,470
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

173
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,830
But you know I can't cancel the wedding.

174
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,800
I know. I know it very well.

175
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

176
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,400
Liar.

177
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,910
Mean.

178
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,320
Selfish.

179
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,160
What was that for? What did I do to deserve such verbal abuse?

180
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,910
Because you know that I'll eventually cave in.

181
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,190
Because I know who truly understands me.

182
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,150
Lom taught you that, right?

183
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,150
Lom must have taught you to be so cunning.

184
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,600
No.

185
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,630
But I know that a certain someone will indulge me.

186
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,110
Will you indulge me?

187
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,790
Are you going to indulge me?

188
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,080
Please.

189
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,030
Please indulge me. Please, please, please, please.

190
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,670
Will you indulge me? Will you?

191
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,830
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?

192
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,000
Will you indulge me?

193
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,840
The bride can't make it?

194
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,310
What do you mean the bride can't make it?

195
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,590
That's what I'm telling you.

196
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,390
Yiwa won't be joining us today. It'll be just me.

197
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,150
She'll have her fitting separately.

198
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,960
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

199
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,910
Have I ever said that Yiwa would come?

200
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,470
You said it yourself that Yiwa would...

201
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,150
Yiwa will join us at the boutique later, right?

202
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,670
Come sit in the front.

203
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,520
[Okay. I'll send you the location.]

204
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,520
[Will you come with me for the fitting?]

205
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,110
[I'll pick you up at your company later.]

206
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,110
[It's okay.]

207
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,430
You never mentioned anything about Yiwa joining us.

208
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,800
But I jumped to the conclusion.

209
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,870
Yes, I never said that she'd be here.

210
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,950
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,190
Why are you apologizing?

212
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,510
I'm truly sorry.

213
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,030
Please don't be mad at me.

214
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,030
[Don't be crazy, Nuea. How could you think he's cute?]

215
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,310
I'm sorry too.

216
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,079
In fact, I don't have any right to be mad at you.

217
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,840
I was just afraid that you'd be okay with anything again.

218
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,160
It doesn't matter if the wedding dress doesn't fit.

219
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,230
I know that most brides will change their dress choices

220
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,350
because their aesthetics constantly changes.

221
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,920
But Yiwa will surely be attending the dress fitting, right?

222
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,030
Yes, she'll come with her best friend within this week.

223
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,920
Please don't worry.

224
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,310
Yiwa already has a wedding dress style in mind.

225
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,000
As for the engagement outfits, my family will take care of them.

226
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,160
That's a relief.

227
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,670
Then, let's start the fitting.

228
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,110
-Please.
-Thank you.

229
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,670
Thank you for coming with me today.

230
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,750
I wouldn't know what to do without you.

231
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,110
As for the wedding suit,

232
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,310
I trust you.

233
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,840
Let's not waste any more time.

234
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,520
We'd better get started.

235
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,880
I'll go get the shop assistant.

236
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,150
Next, please.

237
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,990
Next, please.

238
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,510
Next, please.

239
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,790
Next, please.

240
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,910
Next, please.

241
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,030
Next, please.

242
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,830
Next, please. Next, please. Next, please.

243
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,430
Next, please.

244
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,030
Next, please. Next, please. Next, please. Next, please. Next, please. Next, please.

245
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,670
Next, please.

246
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,470
This is just the first store, and you're already tired?

247
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,430
The first and only one.

248
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,540
If I hear “Next, please” from you one more time,

249
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,000
I swear I'll sabotage my own wedding.

250
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,150
So, Lom. Which one is your favorite?

251
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,600
When did you print them?

252
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,470
It's a secret of my profession.

253
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,670
My principle is to be prepared for every situation.

254
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,080
So, which one do you prefer?

255
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,630
What about you?

256
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,790
Me?

257
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,710
I need a suggestion.

258
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,590
I think every outfit looks good on you.

259
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,750
You're handsome and can pull off any outfit.

260
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,160
And they all flatter your body shape.

261
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,630
But if you want my opinion...

262
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,880
I'd go with this one.

263
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,890
I like this one

264
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,840
because it enhances your shoulders and highlights your body shape.

265
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,630
Moreover, this boutique offers a wide range of fabrics and colors to choose from.

266
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,830
So, we just need to select them to match Yiwa's dress.

267
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,600
Are you listening to me?

268
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,270
Let me take a look.

269
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,470
If you're good with it, I'm good with it too.

270
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,590
Lom.

271
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,120
I've told you that I trust you.

272
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,350
I believe in your taste too.

273
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,320
And I'm happy.

274
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,270
About what?

275
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,710
That you called me handsome.

276
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,590
With that kind of face, how could I say that he's ugly?

277
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,960
He's got broad shoulders and sharp facial features too.

278
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,230
Even if I was paid a fortune, I couldn't call him ugly.

279
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,750
Who are you talking about?

280
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,470
Excuse me, another glass, please.

281
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,830
Don't dodge the question. Who were you talking about?

282
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,670
The male lead in a series. He's got this side-parting hairstyle.

283
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,520
-What a total hottie.
-Oh, I thought you were talking about Lom.

284
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,400
You said he's hot, with broad shoulders and side-parting hair.

285
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,750
Exactly the traits of your type.

286
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,190
Don't talk nonsense.

287
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,550
Don't you know how long I've known you?

288
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,190
Want me to list the things all the guys you've liked have in common?

289
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,630
Don't, I'm well aware of that.

290
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,350
He clearly flirted with me.

291
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,400
Prize, that hurts.

292
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,590
I was born before you. I'm your senior.

293
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,560
Who told me not to call him Brother Prize

294
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,790
because he didn't want to feel old?

295
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,470
You asked me to call you Prize. Now you want to change your mind?

296
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,910
No, it's not like that.

297
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,200
What I'm trying to say is that

298
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:22,240
there's no harm in admiring a taken handsome man.

299
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,350
But it's a whole different story when you've fallen for him.

300
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,160
Forget it.

301
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,190
I can't say too much because my friend is awesome.

302
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,320
I know that.

303
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,190
Apart from work-related stuff, I won't contact him personally.

304
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,440
Everyone keeps falling for you because you always pull off this cute act.

305
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,560
Forget it.

306
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,960
Where's J'Im?

307
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,840
Oh.

308
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,230
She has to take care of an event setup today.

309
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,910
Did you forget just because it's not your work?

310
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,110
Good thing I'm free tonight. I'm gonna get totally hammered.

311
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,510
Cheers.

312
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,550
Cheer!

313
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:24,790
[When are you free? Let's go check out]

314
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:24,790
[the hotel I set my mind to.]

315
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:24,790
[Sailom]

316
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,990
-What are you doing?
-Cast a fortification spell on your heart

317
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,440
to prevent it from wavering.

318
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Let's eat.

319
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,790
Come on.

320
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,320
Knock, knock, knock.

321
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,720
Constantly sighing will take away your happiness, Mr. Groom.

322
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,350
This groom is overflowing with joy just because his bride has come to see him.

323
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,830
Aww, is there a certain someone you desperately wish you could say that to?

324
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,110
So, what brings you here?

325
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,360
I'm here to see my groom, of course.

326
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,720
It's time to get off work. Let's go home together.

327
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,950
Okay.

328
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,070
Did you see the look on your secretary's face when I said I'd stay the night at your place?

329
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,870
She was so dumbfounded.

330
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,160
It's obvious what she was thinking.

331
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,890
I wonder what kind of look she'd have

332
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,390
if she knew that this isn't my place.

333
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,070
Indeed.

334
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,960
Hello, Lom.

335
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,720
I'm here by invitation.

336
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,950
This shameless girl told me I was invited to the dinner.

337
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,270
That's right. Lom.

338
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,400
We hardly bump into each other even though we live in the same apartment building.

339
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,470
I don't want to interrupt your happy time together.

340
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,430
And I'm sorry that things have turned out like this.

341
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,000
Why are you apologizing? You're doing this for us

342
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,390
and my unique family.

343
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,430
Hey, let's chat later. Come on, it's time for dinner.

344
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,830
So, what's for dinner?

345
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,870
All the dishes are

346
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,910
Lom's favorites.

347
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,270
What about mine?

348
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,590
Marine.

349
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,150
Lom, are you expecting a call from someone?

350
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,510
For example, someone with a beautiful name, like

351
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,950
Namnuea.

352
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,160
Is it the wedding planner you told me about?

353
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,350
Yeah.

354
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,590
He's an innocent, tall, but very sweet boy.

355
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:49,120
He had bright eyes and seemed sincere in everything he said.

356
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,940
Especially when I said, “I'm fine with whatever Lom wants.”

357
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,460
He looked very pitiful.

358
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,060
Then stop messing with him.

359
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,060
Lom, you do it much more than me.

360
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,740
Being a sourpuss in the meeting room.

361
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,260
Ha! Were you trying to get his attention?

362
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,340
Stop it.

363
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,740
But you're not denying that you're waiting for Namnuea's call, right?

364
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,460
So unfair. You two are ganging up on me.

365
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,860
Let me read your palm. Yiwa, the Seer, will read your fate.

366
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,900
How childish of you.

367
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,780
Hmmm, you like Namnuea, don't you?

368
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,260
Oh! It's coming!

369
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,980
I can see it!

370
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,980
You like him very much!

371
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,940
I think the seer watched too much TV.

372
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,700
Fine, don't believe me. I'm gonna get some wine.

373
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,380
[I'll send you the location.]

374
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,380
[Then see you tomorrow?]

375
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,380
[Nuea]

376
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,260
Judging from your smile,

377
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,260
I can stop being jealous of your relationship with Yiwa now, right?

378
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,740
I doubt she'd be attracted to a groom like me.

379
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,140
Excuse for a moment. I need to make a call.

380
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,100
I can tell how he feels without being a seer.

381
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,300
[Nuea Nuea]

382
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,780
[Weren't you supposed to avoid being alone with him?]

383
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,230
We've finally booked a reception hall.

384
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,430
Great. This place is convenient for both Lom and Yiwa.

385
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,460
That's why we were able to secure the hall that matches your preferences.

386
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,220
If this is the place, I already have the layout plan for the reception hall,

387
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,260
so I'll send the 3D plan to you.

388
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,150
There's no need to rush.

389
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,060
How can you not be in a hurry?

390
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,580
I'll send you the invitation template on Monday.

391
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,900
We're running out of time. We need to send the invitations out as soon as possible.

392
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,420
You look very happy.

393
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,750
Of course, I'm very happy.

394
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,180
Then...

395
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,380
How about a celebration?

396
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
Sure!

397
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,420
Nuea, what's wrong?

398
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,620
No, I just feel that...

399
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,460
This place has such a nice atmosphere. It's perfect for a small wedding.

400
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,660
It looks good.

401
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,430
You only have work on your mind, right?

402
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,300
This is a soothing restaurant, isn't it?

403
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,740
-About the wedding food...
-Can we save that for later?

404
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,660
Today, I'm really worn out with all the wedding matters.

405
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,260
We only visited a few hotels, and he's already worn out?

406
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,580
I'm really worn out.

407
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,260
I want to know more about you.

408
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,220
About me?

409
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,220
Your name, Namnuea.

410
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,740
Oh, it's nothing exciting.

411
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,620
I was born during a northern river flood,

412
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,580
so my mom decided to call me Numnuea.

413
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,910
And it's a unique name too.

414
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,300
What about you?

415
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,420
There's no particular story behind my name.

416
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,260
My mom just liked it.

417
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,700
My name is Sailom. My sister's name is Saifon.

418
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,940
You have a sister?

419
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,780
What about you?

420
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,900
I'm an only child.

421
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,860
But I have a lot of cousins.

422
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,180
One of them is the same age as me, but he's already married and has a child.

423
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,820
I was the one who planned his wedding.

424
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,420
It was also the wedding I'm proudest of.

425
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,060
Does it mean you live in Bangkok alone?

426
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,900
Yes, I'm alone here.

427
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,860
But I have many friends and seniors who graduated from the same college

428
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,780
and colleagues at Wiwa Square too.

429
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,340
Do you ever feel lonely?

430
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,420
Lonely? I've been too busy working to feel lonely.

431
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,060
You seem to love your job.

432
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,500
Yes, I love planning weddings.

433
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,700
There are many types of weddings.

434
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,580
Lom, I think you get the...

435
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,740
-Umm...
-I get it.

436
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,260
They can help gain reputation.

437
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,620
Something like that.

438
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,900
But out of all the types of events, weddings are filled with happiness.

439
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,300
A wedding frames the memories shared by two individuals.

440
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,740
While the guests may only remember the food's flavor or the souvenirs,

441
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,740
the bride and groom will remember the day vividly.

442
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,820
I like organizing events to bring joy to people.

443
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,190
I do too.

444
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,180
[I like you.]

445
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
Sorry?

446
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,860
Oh, it's nothing.

447
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,940
Let's talk about you, Lom.

448
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,460
You seem to love each other very much.

449
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,460
Yes, I love Yiwa very much.

450
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,380
I know.

451
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,300
Let's hurry and finish the food. It's getting cold.

452
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,060
Why did you bring me here?

453
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,900
To digest food.

454
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,940
By taking a stroll along the river?

455
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,940
Yes.

456
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,980
Whenever I have something on my mind,

457
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,380
I always come here

458
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,260
to immerse myself in the sounds of ships and water,

459
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,900
to watch the lights on the road,

460
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,590
and enjoy the breeze.

461
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,220
It's as if all my worries are swept away.

462
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,700
You said that you wanted to get to know me.

463
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
So do I.

464
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,580
[Lom]

465
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,980
[Are you aware that you're giving me the wrong idea?]

466
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,740
Nuea! Nuea! Wake up!

467
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,940
What happened?

468
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,860
Did you go to war or something? Why do you look like a zombie?

469
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,100
Do you know what zombies look like?

470
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,420
I'm looking at one right now.

471
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,900
Leave me alone.

472
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,820
The hotel allowed us to stay until midnight, but the after-party dragged on until 4 a.m.

473
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,900
J'Im and Jom were bustling around like headless flies.

474
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,660
You weren't there to help, so mind your own business.

475
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,220
Gee.

476
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,540
Excuse me, yesterday was my day off.

477
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,180
Besides, I already asked for leave from J'Im.

478
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,580
You said it like I was such a bad friend.

479
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,500
Since your body couldn't hold on， why didn't you go home and rest?

480
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,180
I bet J'Im and Jom are fast asleep now.

481
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,270
I just want to forget.

482
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,740
Want to forget?

483
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,580
You're heartbroken?

484
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,460
Not yet. My heart is still intact.

485
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,340
Sure, not broken yet.

486
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,940
As your good friend, I'll believe you.

487
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,540
By the way, how is Lom's wedding coming along?

488
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,300
-Why are you bringing him up?
-It's our job. I should be involved.

489
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,500
We've decided on a reception hall and a wedding theme.

490
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,990
They're leaving the makeup artist and photographer to us.

491
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,300
Lom and Yiwa are okay with all of it.

492
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,550
All that's left is the wedding photo shoot, but their free times don't match up.

493
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,860
Why?

494
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,820
I don't know.

495
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,580
If they can't make it for the shoot, just use existing photos.

496
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,340
That's good. Everything is going smoothly.

497
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,060
You don't look good. Go home. Get some rest.

498
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,220
You're like a zombie who's dying over and over again.

499
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,780
Yeah, I can't hold on anymore. I'll go home first.

500
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,380
[Ms. Yiwa]

501
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,380
Bye.

502
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,140
Hello, Ms. Yiwa.

503
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,500
[Are you Namnuea? Yiwa's wedding planner?]

504
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,340
Yes, that's me.

505
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,510
And you are?

506
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,420
[I'm Yiwa's mother.]

507
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,860
[I'd like to inquire about the status of the wedding preparations.]

508
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,300
[Yiwa doesn't tell me anything. Neither does Lom.]

509
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,620
[So the hotel has been booked, right?]

510
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,260
One moment, please.

511
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,860
Yes, the hotel has been booked.

512
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,340
Lom and Yiwa decided on a wedding

513
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,100
combining Chinese banquet and cocktail themes.

514
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,580
Tables will be arranged for senior family members,

515
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,710
while another area will be designated for guests drinking cocktails.

516
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,780
[I trust you've been informed about the number of guests, right?]

517
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,540
The number of guests?

518
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,660
Oh, yes. Mr. Lom said that about 600 people will come.

519
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,220
[Oh no!]

520
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,020
-Pardon? I haven't messed up.
-Oh my goodness!

521
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,260
[How could Lom say there'd be 600 guests?]

522
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,350
[I talked to Lom's mother, it's almost 1000.]

523
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,020
[Oh, my goodness! How can they invite only 600 people?]

524
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,100
[This is the wedding of my daughter and son-in law!]

525
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,700
[I want to invite my old friends and their families.]

526
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,860
[I have a total of 500 guests on my side, Namnuea.]

527
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,220
[How will you solve this problem?]

528
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,420
[I won't be cutting down on my guest list.]

529
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,850
Please calm down, Ma'am.

530
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,780
I'll work on solving this problem right away.

531
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,100
The hotel has a garden area.

532
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,900
If we open it up, we'll be able to receive more cocktail guests.

533
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,740
[But I don't like gardens!]

534
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,740
[A lot of senior family members will be attending. Please change to a Chinese banquet only.]

535
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,500
[Who are you calling with my phone, mum?]

536
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,230
[You're inviting only 600 guests to the wedding?]

537
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,060
[I won't allow it.]

538
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,300
[Lom and I have already agreed on this.]

539
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,300
[I don't want a wedding full of people I don't know.]

540
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,500
[Nuea, this is Yiwa speaking.]

541
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,200
[I'm sorry for all the commotion.]

542
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,510
[I need to have a talk with my mother.]

543
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,340
Ms. Yiwa. Yiwa...

544
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,020
What the hell?

545
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,260
I'm heading out for a bit.

546
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,580
Hold your horses! Come back. Sit down first.

547
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,940
You won't be going anywhere until I know everything.

548
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,390
Spill.

549
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,260
Lom's wedding was supposed to have 600 guests, but now they've increased it

550
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,500
to 1000.
-Goodness!

551
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,220
Yeah, I'm speechless!

552
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,590
The bride's mother called.

553
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,260
She said 600 wasn't enough because guests on her side were already 500.

554
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,260
I just wanna hang myself.

555
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,020
The deposit was paid just last week.

556
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,700
And Lom didn't answer the phone, so I'm going to his company.

557
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,870
Hang on a minute. Relax and sit down.

558
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,300
Why are you going to him?

559
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,420
Just let them work it out on their own and wait for them to contact you.

560
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,740
Take it easy and don't freak out.

561
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,100
Trust me and follow my lead. Calm down.

562
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,540
Breathe in.

563
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,020
Relax.

564
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,740
And breathe out slowly.

565
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,860
Relax.

566
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,500
Relax.

567
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,700
-Slowly.
-Slowly.

568
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,540
Relax.

569
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,540
Slowly.

570
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,540
-Relax.
-Relax.

571
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,020
-Slowly.
-Slowly.

572
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,180
I can't relax!

573
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,550
Lom, why haven't you answered the phone?

574
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,260
I've been calling you for three days!

575
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,100
Three whole days! Is your phone just an ornament?

576
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,140
Shall we go somewhere else to talk?

577
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Good idea.

578
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,820
You're aware that Yiwa's mother changed the guest number, right?

579
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,330
We agreed on 600 guests,

580
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,430
but how come the headcount has jumped to 1000?

581
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,140
More importantly, I've been calling you for three days, but you won't picked up at all.

582
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,420
Are you aware that you're getting married?

583
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,660
This is a wedding, not a child's play or a circus show.

584
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,540
If this wedding turns into a disaster, it wouldn't just affect my reputation,

585
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,860
my company's reputation will be affected as well.

586
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,980
You know that the reception hall can't hold more than 800 people.

587
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,430
Opening up the garden area won't make up for 1000 guests either.

588
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,420
I don't know what you think of this wedding,

589
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,900
but you're getting married, Lom.

590
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,740
No matter how much you hate complicated matters, you can't avoid them.

591
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,460
Getting married isn't just about the two of you.

592
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,740
It's a union with your partner's family too.

593
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,980
But you made the guest list decision on your own.

594
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,020
And when things go wrong, I'm the one left dealing with the consequences.

595
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,100
Say something already! Don't just stand here without a word!

596
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,140
I told you, I'm not a mind reader.

597
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,410
I can't magically know what you like or dislike!

598
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,870
Or do you want me to loosen your lips so that you can start talking?

599
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,510
Your words, not mine.

600
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,020
♫If he says yes♫

601
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:33,260
♫From this moment on, our hearts shall beat as one♫

602
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,580
♫Will you marry me?♫

603
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,660
♫My answer is clear, and it's "Yes, I do"♫

604
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,740
Let me help.

605
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,580
That's funny.

606
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,620
Princess Yiwa used to be totally clueless about any house chores.

607
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,700
Well, I have a good teacher.

608
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,700
Okay.

609
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,660
By the way, there's something I want to know.

610
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,580
What is it?

611
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,860
When you held Lom's hand...

612
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,380
What made you convinced that he had feelings for Namnuea?

613
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,500
Lom has a secret that he won't tell anyone.

614
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,270
Normally, he has a warm body and warm hands.

615
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,780
His hands turn freezing cold only in one situation.

616
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,820
That is when he feels nervous from being around his crush.

617
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,870
Lom's hands went cold when Nuea was mentioned.

618
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,230
It's obvious how much he likes Nuea.

619
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,180
Just like

620
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,260
how much I like you.

621
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,260
Don't be silly.

622
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,540
Why did you hit me?

623
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,900
I'm angry now.

624
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,180
Your reward.

625
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,300
Wipe all of them dry.

626
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,580
You got it! I'll make sure every dish is dry.
