00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,380
Every time I look at you,I can't help but smile.

3
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,540
You should say those three words.

4
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,100
I love you.

5
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,620
Let me

6
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,740
be a part of your secret.

7
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,740
Okay?

8
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,860
Leave this place where everyone criticizes us

9
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,980
and go where everyone can accept us.

10
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,140
Let's go together, Rine.

11
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,260
This isn't the time to be lovey-dovey.

12
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,020
Hey, Nuea. The bride is missing.

13
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,020
What?

14
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,300
Sister. Hello.

15
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:40,780
[Seventh Step: The Groom's Love Plan]

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,050
Thank you so much for joining us to bless the children in the water sprinkling ceremony.

17
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,020
Don't mention it. I'm happy to be here.

18
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,580
How can I miss out on the wedding of the year?

19
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,660
Oh, but I was told the original plan was to have the ceremony at home.

20
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,460
Did the children change their minds?

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,860
Yes. You know how kids these days are.

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,300
For the sake of convenience,

23
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,700
they slept here last night.

24
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,020
The morning and evening ceremonies will be held here sooner or later.

25
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,940
The bridal chamber ceremony will be held here at night as well.

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,860
It's very convenient.

27
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,820
They are not like us.

28
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,220
We had to get up at 2 a.m. back then.

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,940
That's right. Back then, throwing a wedding was very exhausting.

30
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
Yes.

31
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,340
Please come in. Make yourself at home.

32
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,220
Thank you very much.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,340
Hello, Mr. Pob. Was there a traffic jam on your way here?

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,660
-Thank you for coming to my son's wedding.
-You've searched everywhere? Are you sure?

35
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,050
Make yourself at home. Thank you very much.

36
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,700
I have something important to tell you.

37
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,579
What is this, Miss Im?

38
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,579
It's almost time, but where are your staff?

39
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,780
Can't you see that the guests and the family members are already here?

40
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,740
That's what I want to talk to you about.

41
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,140
Here's the thing.

42
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,220
The bride is gone.

43
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,300
What? The bride is gone?

44
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,060
How is that possible? She's not a ghost!

45
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,660
Did you look carefully?

46
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,820
Calm down.

47
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Let's talk in the dressing room. Let's go.

48
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,060
No, this can't be real.

49
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,660
Wa would never do this to me.

50
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,900
Wa wouldn't embarrass me like this.

51
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,780
-Mr. Jom.
-Yes.

52
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,900
Mr. Jom, go find Wa. Go now.

53
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,500
I did, but I couldn't find her.

54
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,380
I couldn't find her anywhere in the hotel. Aunt.

55
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,260
I went to the reception earlier. They said Yiwa left the hotel last night.

56
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,340
She hasn't come back yet.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,740
What about the makeup floor?

58
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,100
What about the bridesmaids?

59
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,660
What about those who were supposed to stay the night with her?

60
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,850
Did you ask them?

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,380
Yes, I did.

62
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,050
But no one slept with Yiwa last night.

63
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,900
I asked the makeup artist. The makeup artist said she was supposed to come for her makeup at 4 a.m.

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,020
But she hasn't been able to reach her.

65
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,420
We just found out that Yiwa is missing. Aunt.

66
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,620
Then hurry up and find her. The wedding is about to start.

67
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,260
Yes, the wedding is about to start.

68
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,620
That's why I'm here to discuss with you on what we should do next.

69
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,020
The wedding must go on! It must happen!

70
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,420
But we can't do it without a bride. Aunt.

71
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,340
Where's Yiwa?

72
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,980
We don't know. We're looking for Yiwa too.

73
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,180
I don't want to say it like, but in this situation,

74
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,380
if it wasn't an accident, I can only say

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,580
the bride must have run away.

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,980
No. Something might have happened to Wa.

77
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,180
Oh, so what do we do now?

78
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,020
We need to make a decision quickly. We don't have much time.

79
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,140
I won't tolerate this embarrassment.

80
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,780
Go find your daughter and bring her back now.

81
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,740
Where should I find her?

82
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,380
Anywhere.

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,140
-Please calm down.
-Please calm down.

84
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,300
My bride ran away?

85
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,260
No.

86
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420
Don't think like that, Sailom.

87
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,940
Something might have happened to Wa.

88
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,980
I'll call her right away. Hold on.

89
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,540
Everyone.

90
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,340
I asked the hotel staff to check Yiwa's room.

91
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,300
They saw this letter.

92
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Give it to me.

93
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,220
No.

94
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,500
Wa would never do this.

95
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,100
No.

96
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,260
What does this mean?

97
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,900
-Ha.
-Let me see.

98
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,340
When you read this letter, I should already be abroad.

99
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,620
Mom, I'm sorry for being like this.

100
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,620
I'm sorry I can't get married as you wished.

101
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,330
But I love Rine.

102
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,500
She's my happiness.

103
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,220
Sorry, I'm not your good daughter.

104
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,020
Lom, I'm sorry.

105
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,500
I shouldn't have left you on our wedding day. But I can't stand it anymore.

106
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,060
I'm happy with her now.

107
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,460
I hope one day you will meet the one who can make you happy too.

108
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,100
Even if I'm not by your side, I wish you happiness.

109
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,210
I'm sorry I can't be your bride. Because I have my own bride as well.

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,940
Love you, Yiwa.

111
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,580
It's okay, Lom.

112
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,540
Can everyone leave first?

113
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,740
-Lom.
-I beg you.

114
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,460
Can I be alone for a while?

115
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,180
Please.

116
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,620
I think you should leave.

117
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,180
-This way, please.
-Please leave.

118
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,980
-This way.
-Please leave.

119
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,420
-Please follow me.
-Please close the door.

120
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,900
What happened?

121
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,140
I have no idea.

122
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,740
-It started a long time ago.
-What an unlucky day!

123
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,700
It's so embarrassing.

124
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,940
I don't understand why this happened.

125
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,860
Everything is because of you and your daughter.

126
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,780
Isn't that Rine a girl?

127
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,620
You and your daughter have been lying to me and Lom this whole time!

128
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,100
Don't talk about my daughter.

129
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,700
What about Lom? What did he do right?

130
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,420
He's a man. How can he let a woman take Wa away?

131
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,860
Stop. You have no right to criticize my son.

132
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,220
Look at Lom.

133
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,300
Why would my son like someone like your daughter?

134
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,780
Let me tell you.

135
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,220
Someone like Lom can find a woman much better than your daughter.

136
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,659
Have you ever thought about what you said?

137
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,780
If I had, I would've told you.

138
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,940
There's no wedding today.

139
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,300
-Okay.
-Taste my slaps.

140
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,860
We're sorry.

141
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,500
We're truly sorry.

142
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,860
We're sorry.

143
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,500
What is this? They told me to go back not long after I came here.

144
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,660
Can anyone explain to me about what happened?

145
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,020
Well...

146
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,140
We apologize for the unexpected situation.

147
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,180
The hosts will apologize to you later in person.

148
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,730
Anyway, we're sorry.

149
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,820
Please accept our apologies.

150
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,060
How are you?

151
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,060
I'm feeling like myself. How else should I feel?

152
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,580
Well, the wedding is suddenly off.

153
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,460
They said they'd get married first.

154
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,260
I don't know either.

155
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,220
What about Mr. Lom? Did he know about this in advance?

156
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
He didn't seem to know either.

157
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,900
But I think he was shocked.

158
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,380
To be honest,

159
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,420
Ever since I started working, this is the first time I've seen a bride run away.

160
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,140
I don't care why they wanted to get married. Running away on the big day will definitely make him angry.

161
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,100
Look at all the guests they invited and their parents.

162
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,540
He must be really embarrassed.

163
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,500
Do you think so?

164
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,050
Oh? Isn't that the case?

165
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,740
Does everyone think my heart is broken?

166
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,500
I did my best.

167
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,860
You were being so serious.

168
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,020
Can everyone leave first? I want to be alone for a while.

169
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,340
Like this?

170
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,380
And you were holding tightly to Yiwa's letter.

171
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,020
If I didn't, I would've laughed.

172
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,820
Look.

173
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,780
Wa didn't run away on her wedding day on purpose,

174
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,980
but she planned to run away today.

175
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,500
I want you to be happy even without me.

176
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,660
She told me to make the most of this situation.

177
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,020
What's the good of leaving the groom on the wedding day?

178
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,620
Did you know about this? Mr. Lom.

179
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,940
I knew it at the same time as you.

180
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,140
That cheeky girl must have thought that I'd stop her if she told me.

181
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,540
Speak of the devil.

182
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,980
-Hello.
-Hello, the abandoned groom.

183
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,780
Should I pretend to be sad?

184
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,540
Where are you now?

185
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,220
We're in Singapore, Lom. We're going to England tomorrow.

186
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,540
Yes, Lom. Don't worry.

187
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,140
Rine has relatives there. I found a new job too.

188
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,060
Lots of my friends and yours are also in England.

189
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,340
Most of my work is online. I can do it anywhere.

190
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,740
You're talking over each other to keep me from scolding you, right?

191
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,060
-Then will you scold us?
-Yes.

192
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,420
Why didn't you discuss it with me first?

193
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,980
You're bad at acting.

194
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,620
What if I told you and you made a slip?

195
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,860
But no matter what

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,900
I know you will get the message from my letter

197
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,620
and make the most of it.

198
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,340
I will become the one who is wrong in everyone's eyes.

199
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,740
Are you sure?

200
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,780
Yes. If I could turn back time, I would do the same.

201
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,340
Congratulations.

202
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,820
Hey. It's not too late when Rine and I are in wedding dresses.

203
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,290
Now. Your mom won't talk to you about marriage for a long time.

204
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,540
Do whatever you want from now on.

205
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,540
I'll make the most of the situation you created.

206
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,210
We didn't even get to meet up.

207
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,420
It doesn't mean we can't meet again.

208
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,980
I'll wait for your wedding invitation.

209
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,580
Will you plan the wedding for us?

210
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,860
No matter where you are in the world, Namnuea from the Wiwa Square is at your service.

211
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,820
-Okay.
-Okay. It's a deal.

212
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,260
Good luck, Nuea.

213
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,100
Wish you good luck too, Rine.

214
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,180
-Bye.
-Bye, Nuea. Bye, Lom.

215
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,660
-Bye.
-Bye.

216
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,700
Bye.

217
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,220
Should I be jealous?

218
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,260
Well...

219
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,100
Go ahead.

220
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,180
You have the right now.

221
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,020
An abandoned groom

222
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,740
should look more depressed than now.

223
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,940
How should I do it? I can't stop laughing.

224
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,140
What should I do? I'm already in on this with you.

225
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,580
I'm hungry now that I've finally relaxed. Do you want grab something to eat before going back?

226
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,460
How about McDonald's?

227
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
Sure.

228
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,860
Did you hear about what happened to Lom?

229
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,660
Yes. They said his bride ran away, did she?

230
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,420
Yes. They said she ran away with another man.

231
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,660
Really? Is she pregnant with another man's child?

232
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,220
Poor thing.

233
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,940
I feel so bad for him.

234
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,620
I didn't see him around. Did he come back?

235
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,940
He'll be back soon.

236
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,420
I witnessed their love for 13 years.

237
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,690
Yes.

238
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,260
The latest news is that the bride is his first love and his only girlfriend.

239
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,340
How sad would he be?

240
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,140
I can say that he's ruined.

241
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,740
-Yes, ruined.
-Really.

242
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,380
-Look at what happened to his handsome face now.
-Yes.

243
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,810
People see him drinking every day after work.

244
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,300
-Really?
-Yes.

245
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,819
-He's in a mess now.
-Yes.

246
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,859
He looks heartbroken.

247
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
Look.

248
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,540
He turned from a handsome young man to a depressed man.

249
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,859
He drinks every day.

250
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,900
Hello, Mr. Sailom.

251
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,940
You can come in.

252
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,860
Mr. Lom, your coffee.

253
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,260
Thank you.

254
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,220
My Mr. Lom.

255
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,100
How is he?

256
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,100
His condition is bad. He looks very pale and his hair is a mess.

257
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,490
Most importantly,

258
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,780
Mr. Lom just cried.

259
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,140
-He cried?
-Yes.

260
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,060
He wiped his tears secretly.

261
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,020
Looks like he's been crying before I walked in.

262
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,300
Do you know what this is called?

263
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,090
It's called heartbreak.

264
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,740
Oh, Mr. Lom.

265
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,780
I feel sorry for him.

266
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,340
I'm so worried about him. I wonder how he is now.

267
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,740
They've been together for a long time.

268
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,300
I'm going back. Call me if you need anything.

269
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,340
Mr. Lom.

270
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,540
Poor Mr. Lom.

271
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,100
Mr. Lom, please.

272
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,740
Mr. Lom.

273
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,540
We

274
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,660
support you.

275
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,860
Good luck, Mr. Lom.

276
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,660
What's the use of it?

277
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,340
She's gone.

278
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,060
Mr. Lom, how unfortunate.

279
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,620
Lom, have you eaten?

280
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,140
I'm not hungry.

281
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,980
Don't be like that. You need to eat.

282
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,300
I'm not hungry. I'm going back to my room.

283
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
Lom.

284
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,740
Please don't do this.

285
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,540
Mom. You don't have to comfort me.

286
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,820
Don't say that I'm going to be alright when I'm actually not.

287
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,380
I know.

288
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
You've been in love with Yiwa for 10 years.

289
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,180
That hurt your feelings.

290
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,300
But don't forget. There are more than one woman in this world.

291
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,980
There are plenty of women out there who'd be a better match for you.

292
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,820
But Yiwa is the only woman in my world.

293
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,220
Didn't I tell you? I will only marry Yiwa.

294
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,180
She's my first love and my only love. I'll only love her in my life.

295
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,380
I won't marry another woman.

296
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,020
Lom, don't be so persistent.

297
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,980
But Mom taught me to be a persistent person, right?

298
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,820
You told me to love only one person.

299
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,300
Enough.

300
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,290
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

301
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,780
Lom.

302
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,660
Where are you going, kid?

303
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,180
I'm going to drink. Just like any dumped person would do.

304
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
Lom.

305
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,930
Please.

306
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,140
I hope someone can enter Lom's life and let him pull himself together.

307
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,580
Anyone.

308
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,810
I can accept anyone.

309
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,260
So, you pretended to be the pitiful and dumped groom,

310
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,930
and the bride ran away with someone else.

311
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,660
Then you announced it sadly that you'll never marry another woman.

312
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,420
Then you came to get drunk to make yourself more like a dumped person?

313
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,740
Yes.

314
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,900
One more.

315
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,740
I'm seriously curious if anyone else knows that the person spreading the news

316
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,620
and the one sitting here are actually the same person.

317
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,620
You even spilled booze on you and walked to the office like this.

318
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,020
I even wiped my tears.

319
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,460
Oh.

320
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,860
You need facts as evidence to lie.

321
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,220
And I'm drinking right now.

322
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,060
But you're not sad.

323
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,420
Do you want me to be sad?

324
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Oh. Mr. Lom looks sad enough now.

325
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
You haven't styled your hair for a month, right?

326
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,140
Someone who's heartbroken wouldn't have the time to care for his appearance.

327
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,340
People say you're looking pale, but I disagree.

328
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,660
I saw that you eat well and sleep well.

329
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,540
You even went wakeboarding on your day off.

330
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,900
You need to be more restrained.

331
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,820
You're the only one who knows.

332
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,580
You're the only one who grabbed me and took off my clothes.

333
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,940
Are you saying you didn't do those to me?

334
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,780
Today's slogan is

335
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,860
anyone can be a jerk,

336
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,970
including you.

337
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,660
What about my performance?

338
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,140
Performance?

339
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,780
I think just a little

340
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,100
better than before.

341
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
Then...

342
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,980
if I tell you my heart hurts,

343
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,020
will you let me stay in your room?

344
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,260
Does your heart really hurt?

345
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,020
Can't you tell from my face?

346
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,780
Your face only shows

347
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,180
you're lying.

348
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,660
My heart really hurts.

349
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,220
If I don't eat with you, I will have no appetite.

350
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,300
If I don't sleep with you in my arms, I will be up all night.

351
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,500
If I don't see your face,

352
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,620
I will miss you every day.

353
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,980
Have you realized that you're getting more and more cunning?

354
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,940
Don't you like it, Nuea?

355
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,460
Let's go to your place.

356
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,060
But I'll drive.

357
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,020
Don't make that face. Look at how much you've had to drink.

358
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,220
How can you drive after drinking so much?

359
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,140
Very good.

360
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,060
Now you've become a pitiful person.

361
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,860
What will you do next?

362
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,500
Nuea, do you want to ask now?

363
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,180
I want to know.

364
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,100
Brother Lom, answer me first.

365
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,940
Please.

366
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,420
You know my weakness is that you call me brother. But you always call me that.

367
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,900
Brother Lom, just say it if you like it.

368
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,420
Okay. Okay. Fine.

369
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,340
Everyone thinks

370
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,660
I was abandoned and pitiful,

371
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,660
and I'm done with women.

372
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,300
And you, the wedding planner,

373
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,380
as my friend,

374
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,340
comfort me,

375
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,220
and let me open my heart again.

376
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,460
Is this plan approved?

377
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,770
You're a schemer.

378
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,220
Wa helped me open the way.

379
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,060
I have to make the most of it.

380
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,660
But this

381
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,540
may become a long novel.

382
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,700
How so?

383
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,780
I told you I'll always be by your side.

384
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,260
Do you know what J'Im called you?

385
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,900
Jerk.

386
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,500
But what else can I do?

387
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,340
I'm already in love with you.

388
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,500
What do you want to say?

389
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,050
I want you to call yourself Nuea.

390
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,090
Okay.

391
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Brother Lom.

392
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,100
Can we

393
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,420
continue now?

394
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,780
When did Nuea ever stop Brother Lom?

395
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,140
[6 months later]

396
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,020
Brother Lom, wake up.

397
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,900
Brother Lom, wake up and have a look.

398
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,180
Brother Lom.

399
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,060
It's itchy. Don't play with my neck.

400
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,580
Brother Lom.

401
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,620
Are you pretending to be asleep?

402
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,420
I'm really sleeping. I'm not pretending.

403
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,540
Are you sleepwalking now?

404
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,300
Yes.

405
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,500
Brother Lom.

406
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,060
Do you want me to kiss you?

407
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,900
Brush your teeth first.

408
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,580
Why are you so mean to me now?

409
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,660
And you've been getting more handsy with me lately.

410
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,180
Hurry up, Brother Lom.

411
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:59,140
Get up, take a shower and eat. Hurry.

412
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,060
Are you really not going to kiss me?

413
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,900
Dream on.

414
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,180
Hurry up.

415
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,060
I took a shower.

416
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
And then?

417
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,460
I brushed my teeth too.

418
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,300
Okay. And?

419
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,460
Are you satisfied?

420
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,660
Not yet.

421
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,660
Let go of me! Your bulky body is in the way.

422
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,220
Hey, what's that?

423
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,860
This is why I called you in the morning.

424
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,500
I went to get the parcel this morning.

425
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Brother, open it.

426
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,140
They called and told us.

427
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,460
But seeing this makes us so happy.

428
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,300
It would be great if we could attend, right?

429
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,940
I told Rine.

430
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
She understands.

431
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,780
You're still pretending to be dumped. I can't take leave either.

432
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,820
But you have to be the first to call and congratulate them that day.

433
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,180
Well, call them now

434
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,450
and they'll know we got the gift.

435
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,420
It's still late there. We can call later.

436
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,179
I want to get married when I see this.

437
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,020
With whom?

438
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,699
Just kidding.

439
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,420
I would be the one who proposes.

440
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
No.

441
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,060
I must be the one proposing. You can't.

442
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,100
As if we could actually marry.

443
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,139
I hope that day will come.

444
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,820
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

445
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,020
My porridge.

446
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,820
It's burnt.

447
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,580
How about we order takeout?

448
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,100
You should say I'll do it later.

449
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,180
I'm just being realistic.

450
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Lom.

451
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,380
Where are you going on your day off, Son?

452
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,250
To see Mr. Nuea.

453
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,060
Again?

454
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,020
Why are you seeing Mr. Nuea so frequently lately?

455
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,900
I'm happy with him.

456
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,380
Mom. Are you going to stop me from seeing him?

457
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,140
No.

458
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,140
I'm relieved to see you happy.

459
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,980
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

460
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,060
Wait, Lom.

461
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,420
No matter what happens, don't disappear like Wa.

462
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,740
Why?

463
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,580
I know it's hard for me to accept some things.

464
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,300
But you know, right? What I fear the most is losing you.

465
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,020
I won't disappear.

466
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,860
Don't worry, Mom.

467
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,940
Okay. Go find Nuea. Don't let him wait for too long.

468
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,700
This one is done. Okay.

469
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,060
-I'll get going. J'Im.
-Okay.

470
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,060
Huh?

471
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,220
Don't you want to help your friend wrap up?

472
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,900
Where's my work?

473
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,100
You should be grateful that I woke up at the crack of dawn

474
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,380
to help you with flower arrangements.

475
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,420
I got off work at 3 a.m. last night.

476
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,860
Yes, you abandoned your friend now that you've got a boyfriend.

477
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,860
You didn't even help me yesterday.

478
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,460
-I'm a little jealous.
-Hey, stop bickering.

479
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,820
-If you're leaving, just go.
-Your groom is waiting for you, right?

480
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,580
Groom? Lom?

481
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,860
You're so nosy.

482
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,420
Go home now. This bickering fest won't end if you're still here.

483
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,420
-Bye.
-Bye.

484
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,940
Beat it.

485
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,980
-Bye.
-Leave.

486
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Get lost.

487
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,100
Hey, Nuea is in a strangely good mood.

488
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,620
Yeah. I wonder if Lom prepared a surprise for him.

489
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,340
-Is there a surprise?
-Oh.

490
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,620
You didn't know that Khun Lom surprised him once?

491
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,780
He gave Nuea flowers.

492
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,140
We thought it was a sample bouquet from a client and checked it out.

493
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,820
That was when we realized that it was a gift to Nuea from Lom.

494
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,780
Do you know what's written on the card?

495
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,580
He just wanted to give it to him.

496
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,930
-I was so jealous.
-Hey.

497
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,540
-What else is there that I don't know?
-I'll tell you everything.

498
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,940
I don't know anything.

499
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,780
Is anyone in the office normal today?

500
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,140
They're putting more energy into gossip than work.

501
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,300
Why weren't you startled?

502
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,180
Should I pretend to be surprised?

503
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,820
No.

504
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,250
What's on your mind?

505
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,740
I'm thinking about last year's wedding.

506
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,420
It's been a year.

507
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,580
But I'm here all the time to set up weddings, I don't really feel anything.

508
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,980
But it must be an unforgettable memory for you, Brother Lom.

509
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,940
I think so too.

510
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,500
But I was not thinking about what happened back then.

511
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,020
Oh?

512
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,740
I was wondering what our wedding would look like if we decided to have one.

513
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,380
First, we need your mother's permission.

514
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,180
She said yes.

515
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,180
Lom, are you kidding me?

516
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,140
Anything could happen, Nuea.

517
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,940
I was thinking about the moment I would propose to you.

518
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,940
Should I say let's get married

519
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,460
or will you marry me?

520
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,260
Which one is better?

521
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,540
Are you already practicing now?

522
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,900
It's not too early to practice now.

523
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,300
Should I say yes

524
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,420
or cry first?

525
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,380
You think about yours and I think about mine, okay?

526
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,500
It's settled then, Mr. Groom.

527
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,860
Have you ever thought about what should be at a wedding?

528
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,820
Beautiful flowers like in a novel.

529
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,700
Have I said this before?

530
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,820
Of course, you can't find any good food.

531
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,500
Because I like eating.

532
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,900
My friends will be here to congratulate me.

533
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,940
The most important elements are the bride and the groom.

534
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,180
Sometimes,

535
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,260
it's okay if they are the groom and the groom

536
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,300
or the bride and the bride.

537
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,770
Because love can happen between people of the same gender.

538
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,750
Marriage isn't just about two people.

539
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,850
There are many elements involved.

540
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,700
But love

541
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,540
is about two hearts.

542
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,100
That's for certain.

543
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,420
I love you, Brother Lom.

544
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,980
I love you too, Nuea.

545
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,740
Who am I?

546
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,620
I'm just a little wedding planner. How did I win the groom's heart?

547
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,300
♫From someone who didn't know how to love♫

548
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:14,140
♫To the one who's giving his whole heart to you♫

549
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,660
♫I don't know how much love I've given you♫

550
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,580
♫I only know I can love you more♫

551
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,500
♫I've never understood how you did it♫

552
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:36,020
♫It's like you have magic that brightens up my world♫

553
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,380
I have a delivery for Mr. Namnuea.

554
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,940
That's me.

555
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,860
Are you sure it's mine?

556
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,420
Yes. It's for Mr. Namnuea.

557
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,620
Who gave it to me?

558
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,260
[Three words: I love you, Sailom.]

559
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,980
Hello, Brother Lom. What's the occasion for the present?

560
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,620
Really?

561
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,820
[You dream. We do.]
