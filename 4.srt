I want you to experience what I like.

That way, you'll know me better.

8
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,940
I ended up having fun.

9
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,100
Mr. Lom, are you forced to get married?

10
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,420
I know I shouldn't have done that.

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,610
But I can't help it anymore.

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,500
Nuea, I like you.

13

Nuea.

I like you.

Can I kiss you again?

You have no right to kiss me.

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,060
You know that too, right?

18
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,330
I have no right to answer your question.

19
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,060
I know.

20
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,180
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,980
It's okay.

22
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,450
Because

23
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,260
it won't happen again.

24

26
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,130
Will we meet again?

27
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,579
Of course.

28
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,780
I have to plan your wedding.

29
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,020
You won't replace me, will you?

30
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,690
You know that's not what I'm asking.

31
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,700

Don't cry, Nuea.

36
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,579

Lom, did you hear me?

40
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,620
Lom, did you hear me?

41
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,660
You're sighing like the end of the world is here.

42
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,340
Are you coming?

43
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,380
Yes, naughty girl.

44
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,580
What's wrong? Why are you staring at me?

45
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,260
I'm the one who should be asking you this, Lom.

46
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,380
Your problem looks more serious than the coming of the end of the world.

47
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,100
You sighed so seriously.

48
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,140
I think you can learn how to be more likeable from Marine.

49
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,500
It's so tiring to be a good girl at home.

50
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,140
And Marine likes me like that.

51
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,860
Why should I change?

52
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,980
Lom. Don't change the subject. What on earth is the problem?

53
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,980
Is it that obvious?

54
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,380
Really.

55
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,300
Including in the elevator, you must have sighed ten times.

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,620

57
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,780

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,170
Stop acting like an expert.

61

62
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,260

Fine. I'm speechless.

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,260
what happened?

68
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,780
She hated you.

69

70
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
She avoid me every time we meet.

71
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,500
I wouldn't like it either.

72
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,540
Who would want to be a third wheel?

73
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,500
You know Marine.

74
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,540
I bet she must have cried in secret.

75
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,860
Luckily, I realized it in time and stopped her before she left.

76
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,260
Do you want to know how it feels to date someone you like?

77
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,380
You should ask Marine.

78
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,220
What I can say is she blamed herself so much.

79
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,740
She even thought she was a third wheel that ruined our relationship.

80
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,170
Everyone thought we were a couple.

81
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,980
Now, Namnuea must think he made a big mistake.

82
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,940
Because you're going to be a groom soon.

83
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,020
Have you forgotten who you are?

84

I will only see you for work.

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,220
I don't understand why Marine would like you.

88
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Poor girl.

89
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,220
I feel bad for Nuea too.

90
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,970
He hasn't fallen for me yet.

91
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,740
I feel bad for him even if he does. Because he has to date someone as shameless as you.

92
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,940
What's wrong with liking me?

93
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,460
Lom, don't mess with me.

94
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Tell Namnuea the truth.

95
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,820
You're so angry when I mention him.

96
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,140
Hello, Lom. What are you doing?

97
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,660
I was waiting for you.

98
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,220
You look like you're planning something bad with Lom.

99
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,660
I'm innocent. Lom is the bad guy.

100
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,300
-He even messed up my hair.
-Does it hurt?

101
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,140
A call from work, I'll be right back.

102
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,690
What's wrong with Lom? He looks anxious.

103
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,940
You two are so alike.

104
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,780
Oh no.

105
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,740
My head really hurts.

106
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:06,100
I booked a bride training session for Wa, but she doesn't want to go.

107
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,210
She's already pretty, so she doesn't think it's necessary.

108
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,490
Hey.

109
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,890
She can get trained to be prettier.

110
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,500
She can't take it lightly.

111
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,980
My daughter Wa must be the prettiest at the wedding.

112
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,970
Otherwise, it'll be embarrassing if someone else takes the limelight.

113
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,620
I'm going to make Wa so beautiful that Lom can't take his eyes off her.

114
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,740
Is that your future son-in-law? Who is that with him?

115
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,530
Wa's hair isn't that long either.

116
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,380
No, that's not Lom.

117
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,250
I don't like this cafe. Let's go to another shop.

118
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,420
Let's go.

119
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,740
What? Wait.

120
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,260
-He's definitely not Lom.
-You're mistaken.

121
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,100
You go.

122
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,700
Why me? No, you go.

123
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,340
Then you go, Jom.

124
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,340
No, you go.

125
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,020
2:1. You have to go.

126
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,900
-Go.
-No.

127
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,300
-Go.
-No!

128
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,500
Hurry.

129
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,420
Okay.

130
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,090
Nuea.

131
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,380
Nuea.

132
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,740
Do you want some snacks?

133
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,380
Your favorite.

134
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,460
Do you want it?

135
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,780
You eat. I'm not hungry.

136
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Oh no!

137
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,340
Oh no! Jom, the price of flowers has increased.

138
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,220
It's 1,000 baht higher. Here. Look.

139
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,370
Let me see.

140
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,820
Will our budget be enough?

141
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,420
Nuea.

142
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,700
We're going out for a drink tonight. Are you coming?

143
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,100
We're going to your favorite place.

144
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,260
No, you guys go.

145
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,300
-I want to work.
-Unbelievable.

146
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,460
-Are you talking about the vicious supporting actress in the movie?
-Yes.

147
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,900
The vicious supporting actress who chased after the male lead.

148
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,340
It's good. Let's go check it out.

149
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,300
He's not interested at all.

150
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,460
This is bad. How can Nuea not feel hungry?

151
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,660
Really. He's not coming for a drink either.

152
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,980
Maybe it's because he's falling apart inside.

153
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,100
What do you want to know about him?

154
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,020
I never thought I'd ever hear that from you.

155
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,940
This morning, I noticed that all the messages he sent were about someone else.

156
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,860
I was worried.

157
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,010
Really.

158
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,140
In the end...

159
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,860
Nuea.

160
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
I like you.

161
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,980
Can I kiss you again?

162
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,020
Stop thinking about it, Nuea. What's the point of thinking about it?

163
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,740
Forget it all.

164
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,890
Why are you here?

165
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
Are you hungry?

166
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,660
Let's eat here.

167
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,100
It's late, so I changed soda to lemon tea.

168
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,500
I also ordered large cups.

169
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,180
You always eat ketchup.

170
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,780
I've prepared chili sauce and ketchup for you today.

171
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,820
In case you want to have a change...

172
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,090
Mr. Lom, let's get to the point.

173
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,060
Didn't you say you want to talk about work with me?

174
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
This is work.

175
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,900
Inviting me to dinner late at night?

176
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Did you eat today?

177
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,140
-Yes, I did.
-I know you're not good at lying.

178
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,460
I had some snacks.

179
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,370
Breakfast?

180
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Lunch?

181
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,090
What about dinner?

182
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,060
Me too.

183
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,620
Why didn't you eat?

184
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,180
Because I want to eat with you.

185
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,700
It has nothing to do with work.

186
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,050
It does. I don't want my wedding planner to get sick.

187
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,180
Even if I'm sick, it has nothing to do with you.

188
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,660
Why not? You're important to me.

189
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,020
If something happens to you, I'll be sad.

190
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,740
Are you worried that no one will plan your wedding anymore?

191
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,300
I think so.

192
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,740
If you don't eat...

193
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,460
You bought them to cheer me up, didn't you?

194
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,300
You know I'm cheering you up.

195
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,730
Give them back.

196
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,060
I changed my mind.

197
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,820
Do you know you're very cute?

198
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,650
I was born this cute.

199
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,140
-He's here.
-I really can't calm down.

200
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,460
I called him. Wait.

201
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,340
-He'll come.
-Okay.

202
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,020
Lom.

203
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,500
What?

204
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,340
Why are you calling so early in the morning?

205
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,700
Morning? I called you the day before yesterday.

206
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,020
Oh, really? I didn't get it. I was busy.

207
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,810
Oh no.

208
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,900
I'm going to faint.

209
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,099
You're busy eating with Wa's friend, right?

210
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,420
What's her name?

211
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,700
Marine.

212
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,859
She's Wa's friend.

213
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,810
I'm going to faint. You're not married yet.

214
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,740
Yes, not married yet.

215
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,130
How could you do this to Yiwa and us?

216
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
What did I do?

217
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,300
You dated that woman.

218
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,780
I told Wa not to trust her friend.

219
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,300
How is that normal? She totally brainwashed Wa.

220
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,620
The more I talk about her, the angrier Wa gets.

221
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,300
She's trying to steal Lom.

222
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,620
I think you misunderstood.

223
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,180
Marine didn't steal anyone from anyone.

224
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,460
A man eating with a woman

225
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,060
doesn't mean there is something between them.

226
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,730
You really need to change your way of thinking.

227
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,700
What's on your mind is hurting a woman.

228
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,140
My gosh.

229
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,860
You're taking her side instead of my daughter's.

230
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,660
We should believe what Lom said.

231
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,980
I'll talk to my son.

232
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,980
I hope it's true.

233
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,100
You've known Lom for so many years. Don't you know what kind of person he is?

234
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,380
I'll never agree on the other thing.

235
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,580
Yes, really.

236
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,170
I just called to Im, your wedding planner.

237
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,100
She said you're using the photos in your phones instead of taking wedding photos.

238
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,500
How could you do that?

239
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,730
I won't allow it.

240
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,020
You have to take new photos no matter what.

241
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,770
We've already compromised on the guest list.

242
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,540
Please listen to our arrangement on this.

243
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,860
Are you done now? I have a meeting.

244
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,580
Wait, Lom.

245
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,260
You'll do it for me, right?

246
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,620
Can I disobey you?

247
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,980
Of course not.

248
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,460
Okay.

249
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,660
Bye.

250
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,300
Bye, aunt.

251
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
Calm down.

252
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,580
Do they think marriage is a joke?

253
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,330
Then we have to make them take it seriously.

254
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
Hello.

255
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,180
What?

256
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,740
I want to take wedding photos.

257
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,060
You said you'd use the current photos.

258
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,980
You said you wouldn't take new ones.

259
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,140
I'm going crazy.

260
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,570
Calm down, Nuea.

261
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,900
You won't be affected by such a small matter.

262
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,260
Are you okay?

263
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,100
Why did you hit your face?

264
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,420
Well...

265
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,140
No. I just want to be clear-headed.

266
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,660
Your cheek is all red.

267
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,140
You're here early too.

268
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,220
What if I told you I came early to see you sooner?

269
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,500
Mr. Lom.

270
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,650
I'm here to apologize

271
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,780
about my mom suddenly asking us to take wedding photos.

272
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,260
It's okay. It's my job to do that.

273
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,580
Go wait in the changing room.

274
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,220
I'll tell the photographer that the groom is here.

275
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,820
Can we talk first?

276
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,540
Hello, Lom and Nuea.

277
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,980
Did I interrupt you?

278
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,500
No.

279
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,660
Mr. Lom is going in to put on makeup.

280
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,820
Then you can go in together.

281
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,490
It's nice. You two look very close.

282
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,010
No.

283
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,780
Mr. Lom and I were just talking about work.

284
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,820
Please wait in the dressing room.

285
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,100
Okay.

286
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,890
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,250
I said something wrong. I was just joking.

288
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,220
You know he takes things seriously.

289
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,820
He's already mad at me. Why did you make it worse?

290
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,820
I just wanted to help.

291
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,210
If you help in this way, don't help in the future.

292
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,500
You're at fault too.

293
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,940
Tell Nuea the truth.

294
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,660
-Let me tell him.
-No.

295
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,340
I'm looking for a chance.

296
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,770
So slow.

297
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,490
Hello, Mom.

298
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,380
What?

299
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,620
Wait.

300
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,060
Mom! Mom!

301
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,820
We're in big trouble, Lom.

302
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,620
[Moms are here.]

303
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,730
Moms are really here.

304
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,100
Keep working. Don't worry about us.

305
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,380
Hello.

306
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,340
Are you the mothers of the bride and groom?

307
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,660
I'm Namnuea, the planner of this wedding.

308
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,260
I remember you. We talked on the phone.

309
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
Yes.

310
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,940
Mr. Nuea, let me ask you seriously.

311
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,420
Can we add another 100, 200 or 300 guests?

312
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,860
What do you think? You also have many guests to invite.

313
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,140
Yes.

314
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,420
His father alone has a lot of guests.

315
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,140
But the father and son decided on their own.

316
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,700
It gives me a headache just thinking about it.

317
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,660
I don't even know how to face people.

318
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,490
My eldest son only has a few guests on the list.

319
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,940
Let's do as we planned.

320
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,580
Dad didn't say anything, so why are you worried?

321
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
Sailom.

322
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,850
What?

323
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,060
Wow. Dead.

324
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,100
Dead, my baby.

325
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,570
Mom, I'm not dead yet.

326
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,260
So beautiful.

327
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
My daughter is so beautiful.

328
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,500
How can you be so pretty?

329
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:10,340
You'll look more beautiful with this necklace.

330
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,300
Come on, put it on your daughter-in-law.

331
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,940
You're so lucky to have such a beautiful daughter-in-law.

332
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,300
Yiwa.

333
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,180
You're so beautiful.

334
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,940
Don't worry about their requests. Just listen to me.

335
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,540
I think you should get it done as soon as possible.

336
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,940
Let's go.

337
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,660
Take your time, kid.

338
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,820
The package is here.

339
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,220
-Madam Marine, your package.
-Thank you.

340
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,020
[To My Bride]

341
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,300
Hello

342
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,300
Yes, yes.

343
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,010
Oh, the wedding details?

344
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,180
I'll email you the details on Tuesday.

345
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,540
Yes. You want to take wedding photos, right?

346
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,420
Yes. Then you can come to our company to reserve the shooting date.

347
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,660
Okay.

348
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,740
Okay, bye.

349
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
Let's make up.

350
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,130
Why do you want to make up?

351
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,740
I was wrong and I made you angry.

352
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,620
I was not mad at you.

353
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,740
You never smiled at me today.

354
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,700
Smile.

355
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,500
Just ask Ms. Yiwa to smile at you.

356
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,700
But I want to see your smile.

357
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,180
Happy?

358
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,540
Let go if you are.

359
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,740
No.

360
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
Mr. Lom.

361
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,340
Now,

362
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,940
it's my break time.

363
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,420
I'll take a break.

364
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,140
Why are you tired?

365
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,130
Trust me. I'm really tired.

366
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,290
But now...

367
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
I feel much better.

368
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,180
I don't feel tired just being with you.

369
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,020
Just let me be naughty.

370
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,100
I can finally rest assured.

371
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,060
They are finally getting married.

372
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,340
I remember when Lom went abroad for his master's degree.

373
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:58,540
We were worried that they would break up.

374
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,340
In the end, Lom proved that

375
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,860
he only loved my daughter Yiwa.

376
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,900
Of course. He's my son.

377
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,660
Besides, you won't be able to find a son-in-law more perfect than him.

378
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,340
And he's been in love with Yiwa for ten years.

379
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,380
In the end, they'll definitely end up together.

380
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,580
-Aren't they cute?
-Yes.

381
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,460
They match well together, right? Mr. Nuea.

382
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,220
-Aren't they cute?
-Yes.

383
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,580
Look. So cute.

384
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,820
Yes.

385
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,060
They're really a match made in heaven.

386
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,380
They match well together, right? Mr. Nuea.

387
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,090
It's just an impulse.

388
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,780
Are you serious, Nuea? What's on your mind?

389
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,010
Hey, Nuea.

390
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,980
Mom.

391
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,100
I miss you.

392
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,940
I miss home.

393
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,700
What's the matter? Is it something at work?

394
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,500
I want to hug you.

395
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,580
I wish you were here.

396
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,860
I'm so tired.

397
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,740
Nuea, you can come home anytime.

398
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,740
I'll always hug you and comfort you.

399
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,780
But it's too late, Mom.

400
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,020
I'm already in love with him.

401
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,340
I don't know what to do.

402
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,780
I really don't know.

403
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,179
-Excuse me.
-What is it?

404
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,260
Have you seen Mr. Nuea?

405
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,139
He left and said he had to go to the office.

406
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,780
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

407
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,770
Where's Nuea? Lom.

408
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,420
He went back. He's not answering my calls.

409
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,580
You should've told him everything sooner.

410
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,490
I had a bad feeling when I saw the moms.

411
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,740
I don't know what they said to him.

412
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,620
I know.

413
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,380
I planned to invite him to dinner today and tell him everything.

414
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,420
But he ran away first.

415
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,060
Go back and talk to Marine.

416
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,940
Did your mom call to scold Marine?

417
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,020
Yes.

418
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,420
I was so angry when I knew.

419
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,820
I was ready to fight with my mom.

420
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
But Marine stopped me.

421
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,940
Do you know what she said? She said she's used to it.

422
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,090
She's used to what?

423
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,250
Who would get used to seeing her girlfriend being called a thief?

424
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,580
I gave in so much for Mom.

425
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,540
But why doesn't she understand my happiness at all?

426
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,900
Calm down first.

427
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,820
Talk nicely to her.

428
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,060
I'm already very calm, Lom.

429
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,180
Marine, I'm back.

430
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,260
Marine.

431
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,500
-Don't come in.
-What's wrong?

432
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,610
-Don't close the door.
-Don't come in.

433
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,530
Let me see you.

434
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,260
What?

435
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,100
So beautiful.

436
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,860
Here.

437
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,780
See?

438
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,780
Your beauty makes my heart beat faster, just like when we first met.

439
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,460
Stop praising me.

440
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,780
Sometimes I think I'm fine at this height.

441
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,220
Because I can kiss you easily, my bride.

449
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,820
Lom, good timing. I have something to talk to you.

450
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Okay.

451
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,260
I asked people to decorate your room tomorrow.

452
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,860
They'll make your room and study into one room.

453
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,490
Do you need anything else in the study? I'll ask them to keep them away for you.

454
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,060
Mom, why do you want to renovate it?

455
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,300
You're getting married.

456
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,140
I just wanted to prepare a room for you and the bride.

457
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,260
It's okay for you to live in that room alone.

458
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,140
But now Yiwa is moving in. I wanted to expand the room.

459
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,620
It won't be too crowded, right?

460
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,740
And I wanted to make rooms for my grandchildren in advance.

461
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,060
But your dad thinks I'm overreacting.

462
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,900
We already talked.

463
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,420
When we get married, we'll move in the apartment.

464
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,780
Stay in the apartment only when you work late.

465
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,740
You have to live at home when you get married.

466
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,700
But we've made a deal.

467
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,580
What do you want?

468
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,780
Our house is so spacious, but you want to live outside?

469
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,140
There are many rooms. We also have maids.

470
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,010
Isn't it troublesome for you to live outside?

471
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,780
I just want to be alone with Yiwa.

472
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,460
You make it sound like I'm bothering you.

473
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,180
I've been following your wishes all the time,

474
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,140
whether it's the hotel, guest list or the wedding scale.

475
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,020
I don't have any face to lose anymore.

476
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,900
I just want you to stay home after you get married.

477
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,540
You can't even say yes to that?

478
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,900
I've done a lot for you by agreeing to get married.

479
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,290
Lom, come back and talk to me.

480
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,290

481
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,410

482
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,120
We work hard for J'Im every day.

483
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,200
Forever.

484
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,530
It's over.

485
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,440
Hey, Nuea, I'm going home.

486
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,690
Okay, take care.

487
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,720
What are you doing? Aren't you going home?

488
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,770
Even if you work until the day you die, J'Im won't pay you for overtime.

489
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,530
Do you think I don't know J'Im?

490
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:20,370
Go home. I'll go home when I'm done.

491
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,840
You'd better keep your word.

492
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,530
Are you going to let your phone vibrate like that?

493
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,410
My body is trembling because of it.

494
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,680
Go back. I feel sorry for him.

[Answer my call. I want to talk to you.]

501
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,370
Sorry, Mr. Nuea. But I can only do it this way.

502
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,370
Is it true that he feels sorry?

503
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,370

[Nuea]

522
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,650
What is he doing? Is he trying to piss me off?

523
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,250
He's never seen someone who's working hard or what?

524
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,520
[I know I'm disturbing you.]

525
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,000
If you knew, why did you send it?

526
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,360
I'll get hurt too, you know?

527
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,050
I miss you.

528
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,610
Liar.

529
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,170
You love to lie.

530
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:06,810
[Please.]

531
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,610
You answered my phone.

532
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:20,690
Mr. Lom.

533
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:24,730
I just want to tell you that what you're doing is disturbing me.

534
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,160
I have to work. You're not the only client I have.

535
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,450
I can't keep answering your questions like your secretary.

536
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,170
I told you to leave a message if something urgent happens.

537
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,250
Are you listening?

538
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:42,930
Yes.

539
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,770
Why aren't you answering me? Just sit and listen to me scold you?

540
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,360
I'm happy to hear your voice.

541
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,280
So, what do you want to tell me?

542
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,490
Can you come and see me?

543
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,650
Please.

544
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,720
I need to work.

545
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,810
I don't know when I'll finish it.

546
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,960
It's okay.

547
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,330
I'll wait for you at home.

548
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,410
Are you drunk?

549
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,640
I'm glad you came.

550
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,970
Will you wait until dawn if I don't come?

551
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,570
That's my plan.

552
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,400
You said you had something to tell me.

553
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,530
I need to ask you.

554
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,120
Are you okay?

555
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,800
Mr. Nuea.

556
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:59,340
You know what? You're one of the few people

557
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,010
whom I want to share everything with.

558
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,650
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

559
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,850
Maybe a bad thing.

560
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,280
You have to come and see me, someone with so many problems.

561
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,930
For someone my age who are still arguing with their mothers...

562
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,290
Can I help you?

563
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,250
Will you help as a planner

564
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,130
or as someone else?

565
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,290
You sound like I can help as someone else.

566
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,640
Sure.

567
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,720
I know you can.

568
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,560
What do I know?

569
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,050
You're the groom, but I'm just

570
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,440
your wedding planner.

571
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:07,880
If I can help, I can only help as a wedding planner.

572
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:09,610
Please.

573
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:12,280
At least tonight,

574
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,530
not as a wedding planner.

575
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,160
You mean...

576
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,530
As a friend?

577
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,410
Right?

578
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,680
Yes, as a friend.

579
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,210
If you want me to be your friend,

580
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,090
that's okay.

581
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:27,970
You know what?

582
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,520
The word "friend"

583
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:34,930
already make me feel painful.

584
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,690
Lom, we've arrived at your place.

585
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,850
Who are you? Why am I doing this for you?

586
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,730
I'm not your bride.

587
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:27,210
I'll scold you when you wake up.

588
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,530
I took you home. I'll get going.

589
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,370
Nuea is crazy.

590
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,130
Idiot.

591
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:05,570
Who are you? Why am I doing this for you?

592
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,600
You are a scumbag.

593
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,520
You make others emotionally upset.

594
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,810
Why did you kiss me and say you like me?

595
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,040
Do you know how infatuated I am?

596
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,290
I can't change my mind if I like someone.

597
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,490
No.

598
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,210
I'll never come to see you again.

599
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,400
Do you think I'll agree?

600
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,210
Nuea.

601
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,290
I like you.

602
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:17,950
[In the next episode]

603
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,480
Namnuea. Vacation? What does that mean?

604
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,910
When is he coming back?

605
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,230
I don't know. There is no specific time for vacation.

606
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:23,230
Are you Sailom?

607
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,090
We work at Mr. Rayrai's farm.

608
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:25,840
We'll take you to see Nuea.

609
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,000
What if I don't go?

610
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,550
Then you won't be able to see Nuea.

611
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,200
I'm sorry. The backseat is full.

612
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:34,560
Come on, brother. Only a tough man can have the son of this family.

613
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,750
I've been through this.

614
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,330
-How did you get here?
-Can you listen to me first?

615
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,140
Go back where you came from. Don't bother Nuea.
