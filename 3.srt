[Today's quote: no one said it's wrong to have a crush on the groom.]

5
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,150
[Previously]

6
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,520
[It's just that my heart is trembling. It's okay.]

7
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,840
Lom likes Namnuea, right?

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,020
There is no doubt that you like him very much.

9
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,880
I'm Numnuea. Who are you?

10
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,180
[I'm Yiwa's mother.]

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,630
[You know the number of guests, right?]

12
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,350
Mr. Lom said there are about 600 people.

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,150
[Oh no.]

14
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,170
Did you know Yiwa's mother called to change the number of guests?

15
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,490
Tell me what you think.

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,340
Will you not talk before I open your mouth?

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,580
You said that.

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,590
Why did I do that?

19
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,410
What are you doing?

20
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,950
I'm telling you to calm down.

21
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,820
-But...
-What?

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,620
Okay.

23
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,970
I think I'm calm enough to forget what just happened.

24
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,030
We'd better talk about what made me drop what I was doing and come here

25
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,290
and the money spent to get into the gym.

26
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,040
Okay, I'm listening.

27
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,380
Do you know that Yiwa's mother called to talk about the number of guests

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,310
and changed the wedding into a complete Chinese one?

29
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,890
-Yiwa told me.
-Then why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,810
Do you know that if Yiwa's mother didn't call,

31
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,430
how bad your wedding would be?

32
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,520
Have you forgotten what I told you before?

33
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,400
Yes.

34
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,000
What did I forget?

35
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,610
You really forgot everything.

36
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,690
Forget it.

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
How do you feel now?

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,230
I want to hit your face.

39
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,430
Come on.

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,250
Didn't you say you wanted to hip my face? Come on.

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,230
You're so bad.

42
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,750
Yes, I'm bad.

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,860
No, I don't want to play with you anymore.

44
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,470
How is it?

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,670
Are your pressure released now?

46
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,520
You're so bad.

47
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,480
I was worried about you.

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,330
Do you know what you looked like when you came here?

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,130
I thought you were going to die from a stroke.

50
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,110
So you tricked me into working out?

51
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,870
It can help me. I thought it might help you.

52
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,130
But now...

53
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,330
Can you calm down and listen to me now?

54
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,200
Do you remember what I told you?

55
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,200
No matter what I say to Yiwa's family,

56
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,460
you just have to listen to me.

57
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,820
-But actually...
-I'm not done yet.

58
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,330
I talked to Yiwa.

59
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,900
We won't hold a grand wedding according to our parents' ideas,

60
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,010
but it won't be a shameful wedding either.

61
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,750
We'll take care of the number of guests. The number of guests is fixed.

62
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,540
But...

63
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you understand what I said?

64
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,140
No matter what happens, just listen to me.

65
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,100
Since you have your own reason, why didn't you answer my calls?

66
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,510
If I didn't do that,

67
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,700
I wouldn't have been able to see you.

68
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,540
Do you know how I feel now?

69
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,940
I want to hit your face.

70
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,970
Come on.

71
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,930
I'll get you a towel.

72
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:39,480
Step three, print the invitations but don't want to send them.

73
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,640
Are you still angry with me?

74
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,520
About what?

75
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,370
I have nothing to be angry with you about.

76
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,440
I'll do as you say about the wedding.

77
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,890
I'll do as you say from now on.

78
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,570
Anyway, thank you for today.

79
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,350
For what?

80
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,810
I should be the one thanking you for sending me home.

81
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,500
Bye then.

82
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,620
I really want to thank you.

83
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,510
Communicating with clients is my job.

84
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,390
I'm not thanking you as a client,

85
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,680
but as someone called Sailom.

86
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,830
Thank you for everything you did for my wedding.

87
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,090
You're making me blush.

88
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,490
Anyway,

89
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,470
thank you for taking me home.

90
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,620
Take care on your way back.

91
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,520
Wait, Nuea.

92
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,480
You said that if there was anything I particularly liked or wanted,

93
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,010
I could tell you, right?

94
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,650
Yes. It helps us understand the bride and groom's personalities.

95
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,870
And it can help us grasp more details of the wedding.

96
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,680
I have something important to ask you.

97
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,070
Lom. Don't you have something important to talk to me?

98
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,170
Why did you bring me here?

99
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,580
This is the place. This is what I like to do.

100
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,450
What does this have to do with me?

101
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,620
You said if you know what I like,

102
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,140
it can help you plan a better wedding, right?

103
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,900
But that's when you didn't cooperate.

104
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,230
Now that I cooperated with you, you should cooperate with me too.

105
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
What?

106
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,250
I want you to experience what I like.

107
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,350
That way, you'll know me better.

108
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,600
What do you think?

109
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,110
Yes. Hold it like this.

110
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,800
Keep your shoulder stable. Otherwise when you pull, you'll fall and get hurt.

111
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,800
Can I not play?

112
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,150
Give it a try.

113
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,810
Okay.

114
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,210
Just once.

115
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,380
Okay, just once.

116
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,100
Hold the handle and keep your shoulder stable. Bend down to the surf board.

117
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
Otherwise your face will be hit when you pull the rope.

118
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,720
When you want to turn left, pull the handle to the right.

119
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,800
Vice versa.

120
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,980
Let's try.

121
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,690
Okay, turn left.

122
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,980
Yes, turn right.

123
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,700
OK. Face forward.

124
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,890
Not bad.

125
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,950
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

126
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,100
But you're not with me.

127
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,050
Let's start.

128
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,950
Again.

129
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,040
Again.

130
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,980
Again.

131
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,100
One more time. I'm getting there.

132
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,630
One more time.

133
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,590
Do you want to have a rest?

134
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,520
Lom, let me try again, okay? I'm getting there.

135
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,100
Okay? One more time.

136
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,540
Okay? One more time, okay?

137
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,820
Okay. Play as many times as you want.

138
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,140
Yeah!

139
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,720
Let's go.

140
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,740
You're such a liar.

141
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,730
Are you happy?

142
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Yes.

143
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,260
But I'd be happier if I wasn't tricked.

144
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,170
I apologize. Don't be mad at me.

145
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,110
Lom, don't make a face like that.

146
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,050
What face?

147
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,100
Like this.

148
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,020
I'm happy that I was born with this face.

149
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,810
You lost to my face, right?

150
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,320
Lom, you

151
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,130
always tease me.

152
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,620
Oh.

153
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,670
I thought it was cool when you were playing.

154
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,900
I only saw photos uploaded by my friends on Instagram.

155
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,770
But when I tried it myself, it's not just scary,

156
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,870
it's very interesting too.

157
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,710
I was thinking about keeping balance on the board like this.

158
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,050
Nuea, I'm sorry.

159
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,280
If you do that, you'll fall into water.

160
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,770
You have to balance your body in the middle of the surf board.

161
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,190
Don't lean forward or backward on the front of the surf board.

162
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,410
Do it like this. Let your body remember.

163
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,420
Just as you remember,

164
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,020
you came with me today.

165
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,120
Orange.

166
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,660
What?

167
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,160
What color do you like, Nuea?

168
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,260
I like orange.

169
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,270
When I was in school, I went hiking with my friends.

170
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,110
When I climbed to the top of the mountain,

171
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,670
the sun was about to set.

172
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,940
At that time, the sunset was orange.

173
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,340
It made me feel free.

174
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,770
No one could force me.

175
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,650
No one would restrict my actions.

176
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,160
At that time, the sunset

177
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,560
was like a lamp in my life.

178
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,310
So if I get married, I hope the wedding color

179
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,490
is orange.

180
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,740
Like this.

181
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,720
I finally got inspiration.

182
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,880
But you can call me about this.

183
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,690
This is just a reference.

184
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,300
Lom, you tricked me here

185
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,970
because you have no friends to play with, so you tricked me here?

186
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,950
Yes.

187
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,430
It's just a reference.

188
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,950
[I want to be with you.]

189
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,440
Do you know that you're attractive when you eat?

190
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,700
You're rude.

191
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,070
Take your time.

192
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,290
Eat first. Don't choke.

193
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,790
Let me tell you.

194
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,820
You have no manners. You stare at people when they eat.

195
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,400
Do you know how long I've been watching you eat?

196
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,260
You mean the time when I got sauce on my mouth?

197
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,760
Lom, you...

198
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,750
If you want to say it, just say it.

199
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,530
Don't beat around the bush.

200
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,330
No, before that.

201
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,350
Before that?

202
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,770
Eat up. The food will get cold.

203
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,560
Are you crazy?

204
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,090
Maybe.

205
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,870
Eat this.

206
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,860
If you have any questions, ask me.

207
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,090
Well...

208
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,620
I'm not sure if I should ask.

209
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,340
Ask first.

210
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,080
Lom.

211
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,210
Are you forced to get married?

212
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,520
What made you think that?

213
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,810
[Everything you did.]

214
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,580
But

215
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,560
it's okay if you don't want to answer.

216
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,240
[Can I tell you now?]

217
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,280
[Tell him everything.]

218
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,930
You might think there's something between me and Yiwa.

219
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,710
Yes.

220
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,830
But that's not true.

221
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,030
I wasn't forced to marry her.

222
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,040
I really want to marry Yiwa.

223
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,290
No. You can't do whatever you want.

224
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,200
Right.

225
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,220
I don't know what I was asking and how it turned out like that.

226
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,410
I'm sorry.

227
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,250
Why are you apologizing? I should apologize to you

228
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,840
-for asking you such a stupid question.
-I'm sorry.

229
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,310
I'm sorry for many things.

230
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,580
I think we should keep eating.

231
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,700
A bottle of beer, please.

232
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:19,210
J'Im, probably because the client wants the beach, a comfortable style.

233
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,600
What about the theme color?

234
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,890
It's about this color. It's their request.

235
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,200
Did they agree?

236
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,290
What's wrong with Nuea today?

237
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,670
I don't know.

238
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,680
I'm not Prise.

239
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,120
I lost my appetite.

240
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,860
J'Im, I don't mind you hitting me. But don't crush my snacks.

241
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,950
It's hard.

242
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,620
If it's too hard, don't eat it.

243
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,280
This is a place for work, not a pigsty.

244
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,210
You like to eat, right?

245
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,200
-Move.
-J'Im.

246
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,800
Stop eating. I'll see how you're going to eat.

247
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,760
Watch me.

248
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,050
So what's up with you?

249
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm hungry. Do you have a short memory?

250
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,340
I'll hit you with a snack bag.

251
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,200
Where are you going to get one? You already took all the snacks.

252
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,450
Nuea, don't hide it.

253
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,140
What on earth is up with you?

254
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,630
No matter how much you liked eating something, you're never like this when you work.

255
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,390
You've been like this for days.

256
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,190
What is this?

257
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,820
Lom's wedding invitation.

258
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,820
Why didn't you send it to the client?

259
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,980
I wanted to go, but you interrupted me.

260
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,610
Then go. Don't forget. We're all busy next week.

261
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,440
I work in the afternoon and you work at night.

262
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,480
Let me see what you've done.

263
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,590
You acted like you were paying me.

264
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,880
Okay, you didn't interrupt me.

265
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,360
I'm going to meet a client in an hour.

266
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,080
Hurry up.

267
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,770
[Continue. What about the food?]

268
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,470
[They want a menu for the cocktail party.]

269
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,490
J'Im.

270
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,770
What's up?

271
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,500
Do you want some snacks? I won't give it to you.

272
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,980
J'Im.

273
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,780
Is it wrong to like a client?

274
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,360
No.

275
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,240
But that's not right either.

276
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,120
People may not be able to stop their hearts. But they can stop their brains from making mistakes.

277
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,970
Don't get involved in other people's relationships.

278
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,250
In the end, you'll get hurt too.

279
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,910
So don't put your heart into this.

280
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,440
That's right. J'Im.

281
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,830
So who do you like?

282
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,830
It's time for my reservation. Bye, J'Im.

283
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,840
Bye, Jom.

284
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,940
Where is he going? J'Im.

285
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,300
Isn't there an hour left?

286
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:58,830
[Slide to answer]

287
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:58,830
[Lom]

288
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,590
Marine. Thank you for translating this book for me.

289
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,480
I also want to thank you.

290
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,490
Actually, I hope to take more projects this year. But I'm afraid I won't make it in time.

291
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,820
I know.

292
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,800
It's not easy to find a translator as skilled as you.

293
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,810
Nowadays, most publishers need to book a translator for

294
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,620
the translation of novels adapted from TV series one year in advance.

295
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,820
But my publisher booked you too late.

296
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,130
And the author specially asked you to translate.

297
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,680
Are you Tongrak?

298
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,810
Yes, you know how picky she is.

299
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,370
Especially when she proofreads it, I always get goosebumps.

300
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,780
I think it's because she cares a lot about details. I really like her language style.

301
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,370
Translating my favourite writer's book

302
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,400
will motivate me to work harder.

303
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,700
You two get along so well. That's why she only wants you,

304
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,500
although you've never met each other.

305
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,510
All right, let's stop talking about work.

306
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,780
Let's talk about life.

307
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,080
Are you still working as a model?

308
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,550
A little.

309
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,670
But recently, I've been more focused in translating.

310
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,110
What about your relationship?

311
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,870
How is it going with the one you fell in love with at first sight?

312
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,530
Em. Nothing.

313
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,660
It's a secret again?

314
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,260
Since you told me that you met each other when you were a model,

315
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,390
I haven't had a chance to see your other half.

316
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,520
[Two years ago]

317
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,070
Seriously, why do you insist on using this model?

318
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,400
I went to the social media, and she wasn't popular.

319
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,400
That's right.

320
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,420
She's pretty. But I don't think she's suitable for this commercial.

321
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,930
It seems like Yiwa's first project is going to be ruined.

322
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,930
In my opinion, my daughter is better at posing than her.

323
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,130
Are you Marine?

324
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,030
I've been your fan for a long time.

325
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,940
You're super charming.

326
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,770
I saw the photos you took for the latest magazine. They were amazing.

327
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,600
Your eyes gave me goosebumps.

328
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,720
I even bought a few books.

329
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,930
When I was assigned to do this lipstick commercial, I thought of you at once.

330
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,410
But your colleagues might think I'm not suitable for this job.

331
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,660
Here.

332
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,820
You're having a good chat.

333
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,110
I'm confused. Did our boss assign this project to me or you?

334
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
But it's okay. I know my responsibility.

335
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,750
This is our model for this project. Marine.

336
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,000
I don't want to hear any objections.

337
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,440
She's so cool. I want to keep it a secret.

338
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,510
Again? A secret again?

339
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,760
I really hope Tongrak can write a novel based on this plot.

340
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,710
But it may become a hot boy love story.

341
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,480
Oh, I forgot. I have to go to the printing house.

342
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,640
Bye.

343
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,070
-Bye.
-Bye.

344
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,010
Why should I hide?

345
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,420
[How dare I face her?]

346
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,520
I'm interested in the man she's marrying.

347
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,490
Are you done with work?

348
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,120
I'm so hungry.

349
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,430
Do you want something to eat? This cafe has your favorite.

350
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,580
Feed me.

351
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,610
I shouldn't have praised you for being cool.

352
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,830
Did you just say I was cool?

353
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,580
So, what do you want to eat?

354
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,940
I told you I'll eat if someone feeds me.

355
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,840
You spoiled girl.

356
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
Cunning.

357
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,390
Bad.

358
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,840
Hello?

359
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,590
Do you want to change the meeting place?

360
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,860
Okay, see you later.

361
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,160
When did my gaydar get confused?

362
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,270
[I'll keep]

363
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,840
[this invitation.]

364
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,990
Hey, you...

365
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,050
Can I ask you a question?

366
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,640
You said Lom has been feeling down lately.

367
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,850
I want to know why he didn't tell Nuea your wedding is fake.

368
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,570
Did you forget that I didn't tell you either?

369
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,860
Yes, for half a year.

370
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,580
We had a huge fight.

371
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,330
Because I don't want to hurt him.

372
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,370
You know what my family and Lom's family are like.

373
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,550
I don't think he wants hurt me either.

374
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,590
Lom and Nuea have only known each other for a month.

375
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,890
He doesn't want to take such a risk.

376
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,800
Marine. We've been together for 13 years.

377
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,770
For 13 years, no one knows that I actually like girls.

378
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,420
But Lom never looked at any woman either.

379
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,130
We've been keeping this secret for too long. We have to keep doing this.

380
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,850
But I'm glad to have met you.

381
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,030
I'm glad you didn't run away from me because of what others said.

382
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,750
I want Lom to meet someone like you too.

383
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,590
Is that him?

384
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,610
I hope so.

385
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,140
So, can you feed me?

386
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,420
Eat yourself.

387
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,700
Marine is so cruel.

388
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,600
I can eat myself.

389
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,070
Lom, that's enough.

390
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,810
You're getting married soon.

391
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,060
[I'll send the invitation sample to your company tomorrow.]

392
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,060
[Nuea]

393
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,540
Lom, you're late.

394
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,320
Mom, you're still up?

395
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,400
If I went to bed, I wouldn't have found that naughty you went out to play at night.

396
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,910
I was at work.

397
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,690
If you don't believe me, ask the security guard at the office.

398
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,620
I believe you.

399
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,370
But

400
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,260
I'm not trying to pick on you.

401
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,550
I want to remind you that you're getting married soon.

402
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,870
I turned a blind eye when you went out at night before.

403
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,140
But you're getting married soon.

404
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,000
No matter what, you have to sleep at home.

405
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,080
Mom. Yiwa and I are sick of seeing each other.

406
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,630
Don't say that. You're not even married yet.

407
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,700
Mom, I told you before.

408
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,340
In this life, I won't marry any girl other than Yiwa.

409
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,580
She was my first love, my only love, and also the love of my life.

410
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,800
She's also someone you love as much as your daughter.

411
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:16,760
So, you don't ever have to worry about me being with a girl other than her.

412
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,220
You'd better keep your promise.

413
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,350
Of course. I won't have another woman.

414
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,420
I'll go get some documents and then go back to my apartment.

415
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,460
Aren't you staying at home today?

416
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,230
I prefer living in my apartment. You know that.

417
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,990
Whatever.

418
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,730
That's why I don't want to go home.

419
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,430
[I can't answer the phone lately. Text me if anything happens.]

420
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,430
[Nuea]

421
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,990
Just happy to see the message.

422
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,120
What's wrong with you, Lom?

423
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,950
Hello, brother.

424
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,340
Can you do me a favor?

425
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,710
Okay.

426
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:59,740
[Is there a problem with the invitation? Is there anything I need to change?]

427
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:59,740
[Nuea]

428
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,600
Nuea.

429
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,190
The host is here. Go.

430
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,870
Go.

431
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,770
I'm busy today.

432
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,880
Today's quote: if you're weak, you lose.

433
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,000
Be strong. Be strong. Be strong.

434
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,360
Go to work.

435
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,520
Our work is like a war. But all the money went into J'Im's pocket.

436
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,640
Here, after the president's speech,

437
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,550
invite the people on this list to the stage for a group photo.

438
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,750
But

439
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,100
can I make some changes on the closing statement?

440
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,980
-Where?
-Here.

441
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,330
I only mention the president's name.

442
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,290
This place needs to remain the same.

443
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,160
The developer wants to promote the construction company of this project.

444
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,170
Mr. Payu is now a famous architect.

445
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,440
So you need to put his name behind the president.

446
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,800
Okay.

447
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,900
[Nuea. Is the backstage ready?]

448
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,650
[The reporters will be here soon.]

449
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,830
Ready.

450
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,640
-I'm going to the front.
-Okay.

451
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,780
Yes. Focus on work. Don't get distracted.

452
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,790
Hello, everyone.

453
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,170
Today is the opening ceremony of a new apartment project.

454
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:01,120
I would like to ask you to take more pictures of the atmosphere and conduct interviews.

455
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,060
Excuse me.

456
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,000
Wait.

457
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,620
Wait?

458
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,040
Hello.

459
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,000
Hello.

460
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,420
Long time no see.

461
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,640
Long? It's only been a week.

462
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,960
It's been a long time for me.

463
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,360
So, what are you doing here?

464
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,440
Because I want to see you.

465
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,690
Actually, I worked with the president of this company before.

466
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,530
Your joke surprised me.

467
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,870
So,

468
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,150
this is just a coincidence,

469
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,710
right?

470
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,670
I saw Miss Im just now.

471
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,260
She said you didn't drive here.

472
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,290
Then let's leave together today.

473
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,900
I haven't finished my work. How can I go home?

474
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,610
Where did he go?

475
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,430
The ceremony is over. Where did he go?

476
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,060
I kept my promise to you.

477
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,730
You have to keep your promise to me too.

478
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,210
Rain.

479
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,300
You don't even make a sound when you walk.

480
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,710
What is this? Is it from boss?

481
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,730
Can you hold this for me?

482
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,920
I promised that when the time comes, I won't wait any longer.

483
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,260
Do you remember when I took this project,

484
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,180
I told you that when I succeed,

485
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,240
I'll tell you everything?

486
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,660
In addition to being my working partner,

487
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,650
can you consider being my life partner?

488
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,180
Let's get married.

489
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,080
Stay by my side forever.

490
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,570
Now that I've grown up, I can be by your side.

491
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,620
You finally joined the married team.

492
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,410
Payu.

493
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,680
Kiss me in front of Sky.

494
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,120
Pai, look at him.

495
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,010
Do you want a kiss too?

496
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,880
No.

497
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,100
Well done. Thank you for today.

498
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,110
You look happy.

499
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,630
Lom. When Payu came to me,

500
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:31,920
I was shocked that the architect who designed this project

501
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,840
wanted to have a private chat with me.

502
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,700
But he suddenly bowed and asked me to help him propose to his boyfriend.

503
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,280
His face was filled with pure happiness and joy.

504
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,910
How can I say no?

505
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,550
That's great.

506
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,390
My hands are cold.

507
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,570
The air conditioner is set at a low temperature too today.

508
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,200
Can I borrow your hand?

509
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:38,170
Just today.

510
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,480
Because your hands are cold.

511
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,000
I know I shouldn't have done that.

512
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:38,540
I know.

513
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,840
But

514
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,910
you know you're getting married soon, right?

515
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,140
I know.

516
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,950
I know I have no right to do that.

517
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,830
But I am about to kiss you.

518
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,960
I know I have no right to kiss you.

519
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:19,260
But I have to tell you something.

520
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,520
I can't control it.

521
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,560
Nuea.

522
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,410
I like you.

523
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,130
[Do you know that Yiwa's mom called to change the number of guests?]

524
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,370
[You didn't answer my calls for three days.]

525
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,780
[Do you know you're getting married?]

526
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,170
Marriage is not just between the two of you.

527
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,430
It means you'll be combined with your partner's family.

528
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,310
Say something. Don't just stand here.

529
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,460
Or will you only talk after I open your mouth?

530
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,270
I like you. I can't control it now.

531
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:51,870
Why? Is there anything you want to ask me?

532
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:51,870
[In the next episode]

533
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,730
For example, love.

534
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,600
Do you know I'm chasing you?

535
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,430
If you want me to stay by your side as a friend,

536
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,290
let's be friends.

537
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,360
You jerk.

538
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,240
You're disturbing my feelings.

539
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,440
Why did you kiss me and like me?

540
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,340
Do you know that I'm serious?

541
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,910
If I like someone, I won't give up easily.
