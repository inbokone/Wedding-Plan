1
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,840
What you’re doing is disturbing me.

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,200
I have other clients to attend to, not just you.

3
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,800
How nice. You guys seem close.

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,720
I’m sorry, Khun Nuea, but you’ve left me no choice.

5
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,039
You’re a groom-to-be, and I’m just your wedding planner.

6
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,880
If you want me to stay by your side as a friend, then a friend it is.

7
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
Khun Lom, kiss me.

8
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,880
What have you done, Nuea?

9
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,000
You had sex with…

10
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,560
A groom-to-be.

11
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,320
You’re so mean.

12
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,040
Why did you confess to me?

13
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,600
Must go home.

14
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,520
You need to go home, Nuea.

15
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,440
I don’t have that right anymore.

16
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,159
And…

17
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,520
Goodbye.

18
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,880
Fifth Step: Another Attempt of Love

19
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,960
𝘏𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘰.

20
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
J’ Im.

21
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,800
Can I take some time off?

22
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,040

24
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,480
...what happened?

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,159
Nuea?

27
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Khun Nuea.

28
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
Nuea.

29
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Nuea.

30
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Nuea.

31
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Khun Nuea.

32
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,080
Nuea.

33
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,040
What do you mean, Namnuea is on vacation leave?

34
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,200
It means exactly what I told you.

35
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,160
Nuea is on vacation leave. What part of it don’t you understand?

36
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,320
Look, P’ Jom, a face-off between Garuda and Naga.

37
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,800
Who's Garuda, and who's Naga?

38
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,560
J’ Im is obviously Garuda. Look at how she wants to gouge Khun Lom’s eyes out.

39
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,960
But she looks more like a lioness protecting her cub.

40
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,360
I bet she’d pounce on him if she could.

41
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
When is he coming back?

42
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,640
I have no idea. It’s an indefinite leave.

43
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,840
I never knew this company would be so generous in allowing indefinite leave.

44
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,680
That’s right. The generosity is beyond comparison.

45
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Oh, you must be worried about your wedding.

46
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,440
Please rest assured because I will be taking over the preparations.

47
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,360
You will get satisfaction that is worth every penny.

48
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,520
If there is nothing else, please kindly leave because we still have work to do.

49
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,480
My wedding planner is Namnuea, not Khun Im.

50
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,240
Oh, so you’re aware that you’re a groom.

51
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,760
Isn’t that impressive?

52
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,280
I don’t have time to play with you.

53
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
But how could you have time to play with Nuea’s feelings?

54
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,039
You’re right. Namnuea is your wedding planner.

55
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,720
But do you know what he told me this morning?

56
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,320
He said he no longer had the right to organize your wedding.

57
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Not even the right to face Khun Yiwa.

58
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
Nor the right to apologize to your bride.

59
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,560
I’ve known Nuea for four years.

60
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,200
He loves this job.

61
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
Not once did he abandon work.

62
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,760
Not once did he fail a task.

63
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,840
And not once did he ever cry to me.

64
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,280
But in less than two months of knowing you, he did all of those things because of you.

65
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,280
Please think about how your inconsiderate behavior has affected someone's feelings.

66
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,000
I really want to see Nuea.

67
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,400
Please let me see him.

68
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
Please leave.

69
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

70
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,560
You should go back to your bride.

71
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,120
What if the bride is here?

72
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,560
Could you hear us out before you judge P’ Lom?

73
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,120
Umm, what exactly is going on here?

74
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,320
Is it what I think it is?

75
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,240
And what do you think it is?

76
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,520
Uh…

77
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,480
Yiwa, you and Marine didn't need to go this far for me.

78
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,840
And let you be the only one making sacrifices?

79
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Are you really going to give Khun Nuea up?

80
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,640
P’ Lom, stop being considerate of me and put yourself first for once.

81
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm the one who gains the most from this wedding.

82
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,200
Everything was my idea. And I’m the one who asked you to help me.

83
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,480
You’ve done so much for me, so how can I just sit back and do nothing?

84
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,600
If the wedding gets canceled, then so be it.

85
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,120
I don’t care about it anymore. I just want to see him.

86
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,280
Our wedding is just a cover up.

87
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,680
She’s the real love of my life.

88
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,640
My relationship with Yiwa is fake.

89
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,920
But my feelings for Namnuea are real.

90
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,080
I’m begging you. Please tell me where he is.

91
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
He should hear the truth from me.

92
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,120
And if he decides not to continue with me

93
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,800
I will give up.

94
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Please.

95
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,920
I’m begging you too, Khun Im.

96
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,680
Please give Khun Nuea a chance to hear P’ Lom out.

97
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,480
In that case

98
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,200
I will look for Nuea’s Chiang Mai home’s contact number and address.

99
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,320
But let me warn you, Khun Lom.

100
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,320
If you pester Nuea after he rejects you, I’ll make sure your wedding really gets canceled.

101
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,320
Thank you.

102
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,600
Go get him, P’ Lom.

103
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
You can do it, big bro.

104
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
Let’s hope he listens to me.

105
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,480
𝘐’𝘮 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬.

106
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,640

107
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,800
Why didn't you let me know when your flight was landing?

108
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,920
I was going to pick you up.

109
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,040
Mom, I’m home.

110
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes, sweetie.

111
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,520
There, there. It’s alright, baby.

112
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,760
You're home now.

113
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,720
You’re going to be okay.

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,840
Nuea, time for dinner.

117
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,960
Nuea, did you hear me?

118
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,640
Namnuea!

119
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,080
Jeez, Mom, you almost hurt my ears. There was no need to shout.

120
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,120
And I almost hurt my mouth from shouting too.

121
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,319
Let me see. Your mouth hurts?

122
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
Should I get you some medicine?

123
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,440
You’re still joking?

124
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,240
I don’t see you laugh, though.

125
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,160
What happened in Bangkok?

126
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Nuea.

127
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,760
I hope you know that no matter what happens...

128
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,560
you will always be my son.

129
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,400
I messed up, Mom.

130
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,040
Big time.

131
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,920
Can you tell me what you did?

132
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,320
I'm scared to tell you.

133
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,680
I don’t want to talk about it.

134
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,920
Why would you hide it and let it weigh on you?

135
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,600
Well…

136
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
I don’t want to let it weigh on you too.

137
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,320
Then what use am I to you?

138
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,080
Tell me who hurt you.

139
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
No, he didn’t do anything.

140
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
I did it to myself.

141
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,080
I made a mistake, Mom.

142
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,000
An unforgivable one.

143
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,160
I shouldn’t have been easily swayed.

144
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,360
I was easy.

145
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,120
I love him, even though…

146
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,160
he already belongs to someone else.

147
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,480
I have only myself to blame.

148
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,720
I got involved with a guy who’s about to get married.

149
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,920
I’m sorry for becoming this kind of person.

150
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,400
I’m sorry.

151
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,640
Nuea, listen to me.

152
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,600
Everyone makes mistakes.

153
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,920
No one always does the right thing.

154
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,200
But being a good or bad person comes down to whether you know what you did wrong

155
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,840
and are willing to make it right.

156
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,040
Sweetie, if you were a bad person...

157
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,120
you wouldn’t have cried...

158
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,400
or felt guilty like you do now.

159
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,480
Now you have distanced yourself from him.

160
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,600
You’ve been trying to make everything right.

161
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,880
It’s alright now.

162
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,320
I promise, Mom.

163
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,800
I won’t do it again. I promise.

164
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,440
Look at you, all disheveled.

165
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,960
My handsome boy isn’t handsome anymore.

166
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,920
But I’m still cute.

167
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,160
You’re really into yourself.

168
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,680
I’m happy to be back home.

169
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,040
You’d better not be lying.

170
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
You hadn’t come home for years.

171
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,960
Come on, Mom, believe me.

172
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
Please.

173
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,680
Get back to your cheerful self soon.

174
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,360
I’m counting on you.

175
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,480
Okay, Auntie. You can leave it to me.

176
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Do it, Sun.

177
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,000
You got it, P’ Ray.

178
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,400
I’m sorry.

179
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,680
I don’t know you, but I really have to do this.

180
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,960
- Do it, Camp. - Got it.

181
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,320
- One, two, three. - Go!

182
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,240
What the…

183
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,600
Ray! Mom! What's the meaning of this?!

184
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,080
Get back to your cheerful self soon, son.

185
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,520
Mom! You can’t do this to me! And who are you guys!?

186
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
(𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘸𝘦𝘦 𝘖𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘦 𝘖𝘳𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘥)

187
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,040
Wow, this place has changed so much since I last came here a few years ago.

188
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,800
Hey, next time you wanna show me the orchard, give me a proper heads-up.

189
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,520
There was no need to kidnap me.

190
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,600
You would have lazed around at home if I hadn’t taken you here.

191
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,640
You had been away for so long. Come out and meet new faces.

192
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,320
Uncle Nuea hasn’t met his nephew yet since he was born.

193
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,680
Oh, where is he?

194
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,440
At downtown home.

195
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,960
Then I would like to show you my deep gratitude, Khun Rayrai

196
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,000
for sparing your time and leaving your baby at home

197
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,120
to accompany this cousin of yours for a breath of fresh air up here.

198
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,320
My mom’s request, right?

199
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,000
Is it about love?

200
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Yeah.

201
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,320
But I’m going to move on now.

202
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,200
As your close cousin, tell me if any of these workers catch your eye.

203
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,960
I’ll hook you up.

204
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,520
Then I’m going with that guy.

205
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,120
He almost ripped my arms off. Bet he has great stamina.

206
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,080
That guy is off limits.

207
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,480
Oh my god, this is so hilarious!

208
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,160
Hey, isn’t that your little brother?

209
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,560
What is Ryu doing over there? Did he finally decide to help out?

210
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,280
Yeah. That’s Ryu.

211
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,640
And the guy you pointed at is his boyfriend.

212
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,000
Whoa, Ryu is eventually into guys!?

213
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,880
That’s right.

214
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,920
That guy is Sun. He goes to the same university as Ryu.

215
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,960
Ever since he said he wished to be our brother-in-law

216
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,680
P’ Rin has been working him hard every summer break.

217
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,880
It’s to prove his sincerity until they graduate.

218
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,880
This family’s sisters are so mean.

219
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,840
But that kid is quite eye candy.

220
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,840
P’ Nuea! It’s really you! P’ Nuea!

221
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,280
I’ve heard you brought your husband home.

222
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,480
No, P’ Nuea. He’s not my husband.

223
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes, I am.

224
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,640
I’m sorry for being violent earlier.

225
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,840
If I don’t do as this family says, they won’t let me have their youngest son.

226
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,280
My name is Sun.

227
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,160
Please take good care of this brother-in-law.

228
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,640
Ai sun, you’ve got a death wish!?

229
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,120
Lively, isn’t it?

230
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,640
Yeah.

231
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,720
Now I know why my mom wanted me to come here.

232
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,760
I’m envious.

233
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,120
If you have an issue with the guy in Bangkok, go talk it out with him.

234
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,280
It’s no longer possible, Ray.

235
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
It’s over.

236
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,400
So, do you wanna stay the night?

237
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,800
Do I have a choice? My mom even packed some clothes for me.

238
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,240
Let me stay here for a few days.

239
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,640
Stay as long as you want.

240
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,640
This is your home too.

241
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,560
You’re also a part of this family.

242
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,880
Don’t pamper me, or I’ll quit my job, pack my bags, and move here.

243
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,560
Go ahead. People here will be thrilled if you do that.

244
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,280
Ouch! That hurts! P’ Ryu. Oww.

245
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,160
Serves you right. You tripped and fell on your own.

246
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,960
Oww, it hurts.

247
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,640
- Does it hurt a lot? - Yes, it is.

248
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,240
But if you kiss the wound for me, the pain will completely disappear.

249
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,040
Ouch!

250
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,920
I see you have a boyfriend.

251
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,640
That explains why you haven't called me lately.

252
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,240
It’s not like that, P’ Nuea. You’re wrong.

253
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,200
That’s right, P’ Nuea.

254
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,640
I’m not his boyfriend.

255
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,040
But I’m his hubby.

256
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,280
Ai Sun! Don’t talk nonsense.

257
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,480
You grazed the wound.

258
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,080
Keep hitting me, and I’ll settle a score with you tonight until you beg for life.

259
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,680
Want me to call P’ Rarin and tell on you?

260
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,360
P’ Ryu, please help me.

261
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Go help the workers with tree pruning tomorrow at 4 a.m.

262
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,280
Yes, Ma’am Your brother-in-law is at your command.

263
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,360
But if a certain beauty prepares me a lunchbox, I’m going to work my tail off.

264
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,280
Who’s a beauty? You’re talking nonsense.

265
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,400
He’s right in front of me.

266
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,240
Not only is he a beauty, but also a wild one.

267
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,680
What the fuck did you say, Ai Sun?!

268
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,240
You're sleeping outside the bedroom tonight.

269
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
P’ Ryu.

270
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,520
Don’t go, P’ Ryu! I was just telling the truth.

271
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,680
Last night was so wild.

272
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,640
It was our game night.

273
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,840
We had a blast playing games last night. I really mean it.

274
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,640
I’d better go after him.

275
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
P’ Ryu.

276
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,560
You're seriously going to let me get bitten by mosquitoes?

277
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,640
Hurry up inside and close the door behind you.

278
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,720
Everyone, if you hear strange noises tonight, just think of it as a cat scratching a wall.

279
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,360
Sweet dreams, everyone.

280
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,360
Good night.

281
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,160
This happens all the time, especially when P’ Rin isn’t around.

282
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,200
If P’ Rin hadn’t gone to visit Lan, this place would have been more lively.

283
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,640
By lively, you mean when Sun got pranked by P’ Rin and Lan until he was wiped out?

284
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,120
I can relate to him because I’ve been through it before.

285
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,360
Please tone down the PDA, P’ Ton. You’re hurting my single soul.

286
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,960
Then get yourself a boyfriend.

287
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,760
I’m sure there's a line of men waiting to be your boyfriend.

288
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,720
It’s not that simple.

289
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,600
What were you thinking, Nuea?

290
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,280
Running away...

291
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,680
isn’t like you at all.

292
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,960
Seeing the sky...

293
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,240
reminds me of that walk I took with him by the river.

294
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,000
Don’t be crazy, Nuea.

295
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,240
You need to move on.

296
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
When you woke up and realized I wasn’t there...

297
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,840
did you try to find me?

298
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,600
Why won’t you listen to the brain?

299
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,360
You’re pathetic, Lom.

300
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,080
If you had just confessed your love to him sooner…

301
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,760
I’m a bastard, Nuea.

302
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,600
I've been selfish.

303
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,560
But you’re the one I’ve always been looking for.

304
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,200
I won’t let things between us end like this.

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,760
There is no one in my life.

319
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,040
I admit that the circumstances might have led him to think that way.

320
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,920
But give me a chance to speak with him.

321
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,680
I want to tell him everything, including my feelings.

322
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,640
I’m begging you.

I will do everything to get him to listen to me.

325
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,040
I know this might come across as selfish, but I won't let it end like this.

326
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,320
I’m flying to Chiang Mai tomorrow.

327
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Please allow me to speak with him.

Sailom. My name is Sailom.

(𝘒𝘩𝘶𝘯 𝘚𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘰𝘮)

331
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,000
Excuse me, are you Sailom?

332
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
No.

333
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,520
I’m sorry. Sorry.

334
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,120
Wrong guy.

335
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,159
Excuse me, are you Sailom?

336
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,960
- No. - Sorry.

337
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,679
Excuse me.

338
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Since you’re handsome, is your name Sailom?

339
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,719
What an impressive height.

340
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,200
- Whoa, you’re buff too. - Hey.

341
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
You’ve got to be the one I’m looking for.

342
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,880
Is your name Sailom?

343
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,680
Yes, my name is Sailom.

344
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,600
I knew it. My eyes never fail me.

345
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,560
Your handsome face tells me you’re Sailom.

346
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,680
Ai Camp.

347
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,440
You got it, boss.

348
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,040
This way, please.

349
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,560
Your ride is over there.

350
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,960
My ride?

351
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,400
Don’t you want to meet P’ Nuea?

352
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,160
We’re not shady people.

353
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,000
I’m Sun and this is Ai Camp.

354
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,800
We’re workers from Khun Rarin’s orchard, and we’re here to take you to P’ Namnuea.

355
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,360
And if I refuse?

356
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,040
If you refuse, you can forget about ever meeting P' Nuea.

357
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,360
Let me tell you something. This family is as fierce as a pit bull.

358
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,960
And I should warn you.

359
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,440
They sent me because I’m awful AF at driving up mountains.

360
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,160
Sorry, man. The backseat’s full.

361
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,800
Are you okay? We’re almost halfway there.

362
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,200
Hey, drive properly! Eyes on the road! Eyes on the road!

363
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,440
My eyes are on the road. Just hang on tight.

364
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,880
Don’t worry, man.

365
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,400
My boss is like a human GPS, but also a wheel wobbler.

366
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,360
Don’t die just yet.

367
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,000
And use the bag if you’re gonna throw up. I don’t wanna clean up.

368
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,480
Hang in there.

369
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,520
Quote of the day: Only the tough one can get this family’s son.

370
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,520
I've been through that before. Piece of cake.

371
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,360
Ai Camp, look at him. Think he can make it?

372
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,360
Hey.

373
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,240
- Hmm? - How do you think P’ Lom is doing right now?

374
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,320
Should I start sulking?

375
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,640
You’re thinking of another guy when you’re with me.

376
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,280
The guy...

377
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,560
who is your groom-to-be?

378
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,360
- Come on, Marine. - Don’t “Come on, Marine” me.

379
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,120
Is it not because of your wedding scheme that everything has come to this point?

380
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,480
But it’s the only way I can escape my family.

381
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,840
But I promise you that one day we can stand side by side without worrying about others.

382
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,920
And you already know about my divorce plan.

383
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,320
As for now… I’m sorry.

384
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,360
What else can I do? I'm already into a troubled girl like you.

385
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,280
P’ Yiwa.

386
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,320
You’re asking for trouble when you call me like that.

387
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,520
P’ Yiwa.

388
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,000
P’ Yiwa ka, P’ Yiwa kaaa.

389
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,440
You like it when I call you like this?

390
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,560
This takes me back to the first time we met.

391
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,720
Hey, aren’t you just sneaky?

392
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,880
I’m not.

393
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,400
Look! Do you see the bridge over there?

394
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,240
Let’s take a photo there.

395
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,360
Okay, P’ Wa. Let’s go there after dinner.

396
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,920
Happy anniversary.

397
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
What anniversary? You’ve got it wrong.

398
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,160
Today isn’t the day we started dating.

399
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,400
It’s the anniversary of the day we first met.

400
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,960
Thank you, P’ Wa.

401
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,200
Keep calling me by this name. I like it.

402
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Okay.

403
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,880
Speaking of, I’m wondering the same thing.

404
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I know, right?

405
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I wonder how P’ Lom is doing now.

406
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,640
Me too. Right?

407
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,160
P’ Nuea, have you seen Ai Sun? I haven’t seen him since this morning.

408
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,600
I asked the workers, but nobody had seen him.

409
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,720
But he got out of the bedroom at 3 a.m.

410
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,680
Oh, I see. You’re worried.

411
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,000
I would have chewed you out if you weren’t my brother.

412
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,800
I’m not worried about him.

413
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,640
I’m just… afraid he might slip and fall off a cliff.

414
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,440
Sun hasn’t come back yet?

415
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,360
Oh, where did you tell him to go?

416
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,760
To pick someone up at the airport.

417
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,720
Who is it, P’ Ray?

418
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,080
The one who wants to see Nuea.

419
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,240
Don’t tell me…

420
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,160
You've got to give yourself credit for not getting sick while I'm driving.

421
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,880
You okay?

422
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,680
Did you secretly throw up?

423
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,800
How did you get here?

424
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,960
I drove him here.

425
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,160
I’ve been wanting to see you.

426
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,160
But I don’t want to.

427
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,440
Was this your plan, Ray?

428
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,760
No, Auntie asked me to. She wants you guys to talk it out.

429
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,280
But I have nothing to say to you.

430
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,360
Have you forgotten that you’re getting married in a month?

431
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,360
Can you hear me out first? Give me a chance to explain.

432
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,560
There is no need for it.

433
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,680
I’m the one who’s preparing your wedding.

434
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I know the one you’ve loved for more than10 years is your bride, not me.

435
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,120
What happened between us was just…

436
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,600
a careless mistake.

437
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,040
Please go back to Khun Yiwa.

438
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,880
I don’t want to be the cause of anyone’s pain.

439
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,440
As for you, don’t hurt your bride any more than you already have.

440
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,160
Send him back, Ray.

441
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,960
Go back to where you came from.

442
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,600
Stay the hell away from P’ Nuea.

443
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,880
Calm down, P’ Ryu.

444
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,040
Had I known what you did

445
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
I never would have arranged for you to come here.

446
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,240
Nuea shouldn’t have to go through this.

447
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,240
I hope you have a valid explanation because this family doesn’t joke around.

448
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,760
- Let me go! - Stop wriggling.

449
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,200
- Chase him away! - Calm down.

450
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,840
Why did he come here?

451
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,560
What's the use of an explanation at this point?

452
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,320
Isn’t it enough to see me heartbroken?

453
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
Why are you rubbing salt into the wound, Khun Lom?

454
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,800
Please let me move on from you.

455
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,400
Ai Nuea, stop it!

456
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,080
Sadness doesn’t suit you at all.

457
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,960
Nuea, will you hear me out?

458
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,760
There’s no need for it.

459
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,440
I can make rough guesses.

460
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,560
You’re going to say that you don’t love Khun Yiwa.

461
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,320
That you’re not actually getting married.

462
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,320
And that your wedding is just a cover-up.

463
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,400
That’s why you have never paid any attention to it.

464
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,960
I’m not stupid, Khun Lom.

465
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,960
I’ve been alongside you for two months. You think I wouldn’t notice anything strange?

466
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,760
But even if you say you’re gay and not into women

467
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,680
you can’t deny the fact that you’re getting married.

468
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,280
I’m not ready to be in any affair.

469
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,680
And I'm not ready to team up with you to hurt any woman.

470
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,360
It was Yiwa who asked me to be her cover-up.

471
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,160
You almost get everything right

472
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,120
except for one thing that I need you to get straight.

473
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,280
Yiwa and I are not in love with each other.

474
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,480
Your words are one-sided.

475
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,440
It's just as you said, Nuea. I’m not bi. I’m gay.

476
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,520
I have never been interested in women.

477
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,560
And Yiwa has never spared a single glance at any men either.

478
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,640
- But… - The one who came up with this wedding scheme

479
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,200
is her.

480
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,760
Because she wants to be free from her family.

481
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,240
She wants to be with the woman she loves by using me as a shield.

482
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,640
But..

483
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,920
We love each other, Nuea, but as a brother and a sister.

484
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,920
There’s really nothing between us.

485
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,200
The one I’m in love with…

486
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
is you.

487
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,320
If you don’t believe me, you can call Yiwa right now.

488
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,760
Let her confirm that there’s nothing between us.

489
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,320
I know I was hiding things from you, and you don’t have to believe me.

490
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,640
I’m asking you for one more chance.

491
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,800
Can you look at me as an ordinary guy who has feelings for you

492
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
please?

493
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,240
Let’s start over.

494
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,400
Let me pursue you.

495
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,160
Ah, found him!

496
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,840
Let P’ Nuea go right now!

497
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,720
- Ai Sun, drag him away! Hurry up! - Okay.

498
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,440
Sorry, man. I could only buy this much time.

499
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,880
Hey, what are you whispering?

500
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,480
No, I didn’t whisper anything.

501
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,600
Let’s go, or they might order the workers to drag you away.

502
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,720
I won’t give up on you.

503
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,680
Come on.

504
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Hurry up!

505
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,240
Bring him along.

506
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,720
If you want to stay here, you will need to work.

507
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,080
We don't provide food and lodging for free.

508
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,960
Just tell me what I have to do.

509
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,040
We’re now in the same boat.

510
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,280
What’s your call, Nuea?

511
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,280
That’s up to you, Ray.

512
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,720
This orchard belongs to your family.

513
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,920
I’m just a visitor too.

514
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,160
Let’s hope you can take it.

515
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Sun, take him to get changed and start working right away.

516
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,960
He has to start today if he wants to stay today.

517
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,760
What are you looking at? Get to work!

518
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,440
Please don’t mind my boyfriend. He’s got a potty mouth.

519
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,120
But still cute.

520
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,720
Let’s go before we don’t have a place to stay. Come on.

521
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,760
You’re up early.

522
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,840
You woke up earlier than me.

523
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,200
It’s because we had to start working in the orchard at 4 a.m., P’ Nuea.

524
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,560
But I’ve got to hand it to P’ Lom. His endurance is off the charts.

525
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,960
During my first year of trying to prove my love, I almost kicked the bucket.

526
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,760
But P’ Lom is totally fine.

527
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,400
He goes to the gym four days a week. How could he possibly be tired?

528
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Why are you smiling?

529
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,800
I’m happy that you remember something about me.

530
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,480
Please don’t mind my boyfriend. He’s possessive of his big cousin.

531
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,880
Wait, no.

532
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,440
This whole family is possessive of their siblings and cousins.

533
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,040
Ai Sun, shut up.

534
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,160
Are you okay?

535
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,920
Yes, I was able to avoid it.

536
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,680
Don’t lie to me. I heard you cry out.

537
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,840
- Let me take a look. - I told you, I’m really fine.

538
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,360
You’re scalded.

539
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,920
No scald exists that a kiss can't heal.

540
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,920
Ai Sun, I told you to shut up!

Let go of P’ Nuea’s hands. I guess you’re not fucking eating anymore.

548
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,080
Then quit slacking off and get to work.

549
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,040
I should get to work.

550
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,000
Follow me. I’m gonna work your ass off.

551
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,040
Here, P’ Nuea.

552
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,000
Someone asked me on an early morning trip down the mountain to buy this for you.

553
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,400
There's a note inside. Don't forget to read it.

555

You stubborn heart. Why won’t you ever listen to your brain?

556
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,040
Seeing his face alone…

557
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,280
was enough to make my heart race.

558
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,200
You want to pursue me?

559
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,240
Just so you know. It won’t be a walk in the park.

560
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,480
Stop smiling!

561
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,880
What is P’ Nuea doing?

562
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,680
He’s funny.

563
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,240
But I find him cute.

564
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,600
Oh yeah, can I borrow your pickup to go downtown tomorrow?

565
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,840
Sure, but you’ve got to be early.

566
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,440
P’ Ray and P’ Ryu are going to kill me if they find out.

567
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,720
Then can I go now?

568
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,520
Hey, you can't. The road down the mountain is dangerous.

569
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,560
Let’s wait until dawn.

570
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,200
But why do you wanna go downtown?

571
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,280
I just want to see his smile sooner.

572

574
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,680
He’s eating the ice cream to show you that he has received the gift.

575
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,960
Shit, he’s holding P’ Nuea’s hand!

576
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Do you have the right to be jealous?

577
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,120
I know I don’t have that right, but I'm trying to earn it.

578
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,320
Why me?

579
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,560
I don’t know, Nuea.

580
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,520
All I know is that looking at you...

581
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,440
always brings a smile to my face.

582
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,920
I’m sorry for being selfish.

583
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,640
I want to tell you that…
