[The evil groom falls in love with me.]

3
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,110
You just slept with the groom.

[Previously]

5
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,380
Go home, Nuea.

6
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,110
What do you mean?

7
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,030
That's what I mean, Mr. Lom.

8
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,960
Nuea is on leave.

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,550
I'm so bad, Mom. I'm going to disturb those who are getting married.

10
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,340
Mom, I promise I won't do that again.

11
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,700
I admit that he understood what happened.

12
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,170
But I want a chance to explain to him.

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,910
to tell him everything.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,060
including my feelings.

15
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:24,760
Please.

[Hope you like it.]

20
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,080
Hey, Capp.

21
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,730
Push harder
Did they put a rock here?

22
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,550
You didn't lift it?

23
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,660
I worked really hard.

24
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,290
You're amazing.

25
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,810
Are you calling everyone hyeong or something

26
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,200
Don't feel wronged

27
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,260
He is the elder brother

28
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,840
You're older

29
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,090
You're so smart, Capp.

30
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,130
You've been with me for too long. You keep bothering me.

31
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,140
Or are you always annoying?

32
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,680
You're making your brother sad.

33
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,460
How long have you been my brother

34
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm still like you now.

35
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,340
Hey, you're so pretty. You're so pretty.

36
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,070
The pretty Ryu...

37
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,170
He slapped him so hard that he went crazy.
You bastard!

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,440
Come here.

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,079
Stop.

40
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,650
What are you looking at?

41
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm sure Nuea will get the gift.

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,810
Because after 7 p.m.,

43
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,360
no one opened the fridge. I promise.

44
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,790
Are you sure?

45
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,360
Of course.

46
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,780
Ryu had dinner at 6.

47
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,950
He stopped eating after that.

48
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,079
Today, Ray and Brother Ton...

49
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,700
entered the city. It's very convenient.

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,730
And no one else will touch your stuff.

51
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,500
I know that.

52
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,190
I'll find a way to squeeze into this house.

53
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,700
for many years.

54
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,780
Yes. About sneaking into Ryu's room.

55
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,840
He's like this.

56
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,400
Nuea is kind-hearted.

57
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,950
He's still mad at me, but he showed you ice cream.

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,310
He gave you a gift.

59
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,570
That's what Nuea was like when I first met him.

60
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,400
He cares about everyone and takes care of everyone.

61
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,820
He smiled

62
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,290
I laughed.

63
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,680
Keep working

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,080
Wow.

65
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,230
Aren't you going to talk to Nuea? Are you free today?

66
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,440
I'm here to prove my sincerity.

67
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,210
How can you slack off at work?

68
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,720
You can talk to Nuea after you finish your work.

69
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,050
What if Ray comes back first?

70
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,690
Even if I make up with Nuea,

71
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,010
But if I can't win this family's heart,

72
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,020
it's useless.

73
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,320
Because

74
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,720
I want him to know that I really care about this relationship.

75
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,810
Darn it.

76
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,100
So cool.

77
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,420
I'll follow you.

78
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,620
Oh, Capp.

79
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,970
I know hamburgers and ice cream can make people excited.

80
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,260
When will you be softhearted

81
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,580
It depends on time.

82
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,409
Today's order is completed, Mr. Nuea.

83
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,159
Here.

84
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,980
Thank you.

85
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,110
Tell me if you need anything. You're welcome.

86
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,060
Brother Ton and Ray seldom have the chance to enjoy the time alone.

87
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,530
Looks like their second child is about to be born.

88
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,030
I haven't seen my first nephew yet.

89
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,680
I want to play with my nephew in town.

90
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,680
Uncle has been complaining for a long time.

91
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,930
Okay, Mr. Nuea.

92
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,280
Okay.

93
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,880
Okay.

94
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,810
Work hard, bro.

95
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,890
Okay, thank you.

96
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,900
Are you here to check the delivery order, Nuea?

97
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,830
Ray isn't here, so I'm here to help.

98
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,130
Why are you looking at me like that?

99
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,570
If I tell you about the wedding now,

100
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,000
would you listen?

101
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,900
Are you that mad at me?

102
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,159
No.

103
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,350
But I talked to Yiwaa and Marine.

104
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,340
I'm the one who begged you to marry me. Mr. Nuea.

105
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,170
Mr. Nuea. You've seen what kind of person my mom is.

106
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,080
I thought I could be like this forever.

107
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,720
Even if I have to hide it for the rest of my life.

108
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,560
Until I met Marine.

109
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
Rine changed my world.

110
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,530
I wanted to protect her.

111
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,550
Then I had this plan.

112
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,230
I got freedom. And Bom will be free.

113
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,370
So I begged Bro Lom

114
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,110
Then we got married.

115
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,510
Does Lom know the reason?

116
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,419
He may be stronger than you think.

117
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,429
Lom's mom is more serious than my mom.

118
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,080
I’m grateful that his mom did everything for me.

119
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,890
But it's not a way to control everything about Bom.

120
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,860
Lom is not free.

121
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,920
Except for studying in England.

122
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,090
Then...

123
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,730
What's the use of this wedding?

124
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,100
We moved out as soon as we got married.

125
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,730
But we live separately.

126
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,830
We live in the same place.

127
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,840
Even if we go home together,

128
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,560
we don't live together.

129
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,850
But marriage is also good.

130
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,170
Because Lom can see you.

131
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,880
Then why me?

132
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,630
Mr. Nuea wants to hear it from Lom.

133
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,040
But what I can confirm is

134
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,550
the love between me and Bom is not love.

135
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,600
We are family.

136
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,860
Whether it's today or in the future or 13 years ago.

137
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,390
Mr. Nuea, I'm Marine.

138
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,260
I'm Yiwaa's girlfriend.

139
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,810
Hello.

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,090
Hello.

141
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,270
I know we've never met, but please allow me to say something.

142
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,990
I can't say I understand how you feel.

143
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,680
But I was in that situation before.

144
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,880
I won't tell you to get involved in these chaotic stories.

145
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,730
But I beg you for Lom.

146
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,140
Please listen to your explanation, okay?

147
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,490
Lom and Wa have been hiding this for 13 years.

148
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,460
He never told anyone.

149
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,070
Even if we're best friends, I'm sure of one thing.

150
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,690
When they told us,

151
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,230
it means they are sure

152
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,380
it's us.

153
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,500
Thank you.

154
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:06,560
Later. I'll treat you to dinner in Bangkok.

155
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,770
You're welcome. See you later.

156
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,530
Can't I listen with you

157
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,230
No.

158
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,740
This is a secret between Nuea and me.

159
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,940
I'm not telling you.

160
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,220
Why don't you tell me?

161
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,340
Are you sure?

162
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,260
I won't tell you.

163
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,650
I understand why you're getting married.

164
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,610
Don't look at me like that.

165
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,670
Sometimes I forget

166
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,580
how smart

167
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,720
is.

168
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,490
Are we so straightforward?

169
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,710
People here teach me

170
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,430
Teach what?

171
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,040
Sun told me If you don't want to be interrupted while talking,

172
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,220
if you don't want to be interrupted.

173
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,030
I want to tell you that I love...

174
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,330
Nuea is here.

175
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,710
I think it's too late to say three words.

176
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,110
Nuea, help me. A client came to buy oranges. I don't want to talk.

177
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,130
Go talk to them.

178
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,210
Okay.

179
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,530
Stop pulling.

180
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,500
I love you.

181
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,050
I've ordered fruit from the manor.

182
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,530
It's been years, Mr. Nuea.

183
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,000
I have stores all over the country.

184
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,250
The tangerines here are famous because of me.

185
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,620
Everyone in the manor knows me, right, Ryu?

186
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,370
Thank you for your support.

187
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,060
Hey, it's okay.

188
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,200
We're all friends. Right. I know a French restaurant.

189
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,160
It tastes good in town. Shall we try it?

190
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,470
I have good wine to introduce.

191
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,560
I think it would be better if we talk about work first.

192
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,230
Hey, isn't this that scumbag?

193
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,190
Who?
He's the guest of this manor. Hey.

194
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,760
He's always asking for that.

195
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,570
He's been a client since his parents. But there are many problems.

196
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,500
He keeps winking at Ryu.

197
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,560
If I could slap him,

198
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,850
I would slap him.

199
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,520
You can talk at the restaurant when you work.

200
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,250
Didn't Ray tell you? Be nice to me.

201
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,010
You can talk inside.

202
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,860
Your hand doesn't look like someone who works in a manor.

203
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,530
What do you do?

204
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,520
You bastard! Mem grabs Nuea's hand!

205
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,820
I said let go!

206
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,460
Don't forget.

207
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,710
We sell oranges here, not bodies. If you want to grab someone's hand, you have to ask for permission first.

208
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,920
Hey, let go. I got it.

209
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,440
Forget it. I'll come again.

210
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,900
What's the matter, Mr. Lom?

211
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,630
Can I hold your hand?

212
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,200
Ah.

213
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,290
Can I hold your hand?

214
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,100
What?

215
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,510
Mr. Lom.

216
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,850
Mr. Lom, where are you taking me?

217
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,100
I admire their firm attitude in their own way.

218
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,870
Oh, Ryu, are you scared? Give me a hug and comfort. Oh.

219
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,590
Ryu, come and comfort me.

220
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,560
Look how jealous you are.

221
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,590
Mr. Lom, where are you taking me?

222
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,930
Are you jealous?

223
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,440
What do you want to say?

224
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,030
Yes, I'm jealous.

225
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,940
Since when are you qualified to be jealous of me?

226
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,050
I know I'm not qualified.

227
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,670
But I'm trying to get the qualification.

228
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,610
before you grab my hand.

229
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:11,590
Nuea. You don't know how nervous it is to hold your hand.

230
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,860
You...

231
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,070
Is it cold?

232
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,030
Yes.

233
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,590
Your hands are always cold.

234
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,590
No, my hands are not cold.

235
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,870
I'm a hot person and my hands are hot.

236
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,670
My hands get cold when I'm very nervous.

237
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,110
or be with someone I love very much.

238
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,710
But every time...

239
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,470
Sorry, I want to finish this quickly.

240
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,069
Mr. Lom just exercised but his hands are so cold.

241
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,270
My hands are cold.

242
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,550
I can't accept cold things. Yes. But your hands are so cold.

243
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,910
My hands are cold. And the air conditioner is cold today.

244
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,230
Can I borrow your hand?

245
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,710
All this time,

246
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,590
I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.

247
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,350
From McDonald's?

248
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,310
I ate like a pig after that. How could I fall in love with me?

249
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,230
Not at McDonald's.

250
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,470
The first time I saw you was at Brother Pai's wedding.

251
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,230
He was my senior when I was studying in England.

252
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,550
I laughed when I saw you working that day.

253
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,910
Then why did you ask me to be your wedding planner?

254
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,550
Yes.

255
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,950
I've been watching you.

256
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,550
I wanted to be a little happy before I got married.

257
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,990
But the more I know you, The more I wanted to cancel the wedding every day.

258
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,190
Is my hand cold now?

259
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,270
Nuea, I'm just an ordinary person.

260
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,110
I'm nervous, jealous, and overthinking.

261
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,820
I can't calm down in any situation.

262
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,430
Especially when I'm with someone I like,

263
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,550
Like now.

264
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,670
What?

265
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,190
If your hands are colder than this, I'll put a hot water bag in it.

266
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,710
It's better to use your hands instead.

267
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,550
My hands are cold.

268
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,390
Hey, why am I smiling like this?

269
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,750
Sure.

270
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,110
Just tell me when you come back.

271
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,220
That's it.

272
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,070
Hey!

273
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,510
Stay away from me. Do you want to take advantage of me?

274
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,830
We want to know how Nuea is doing. So you're so sad right now, aren't you?

275
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,780
Look at your mouth.

276
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,750
Why? What's wrong with my lips?

277
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,510
My lips are moist. I want to kiss them.

278
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,190
Get lost.
Stop joking.

279
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,190
What did Nuea say?

280
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,430
I think we'll have a brother-in-law soon.

281
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,060
Really
Come on, Jom, cheers

282
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,430
That's right.

283
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,830
Nuea can take care of his sister. You know how good he is.

284
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,670
I'm worried about the future. I don't know how long they're going to hide it.

285
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,470
Don't worry. There are at least three of us.

286
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,670
Yes sister keep protecting them

287
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,150
Why do you make yourself like a lion who protects babies?

288
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,130
A beautiful, noble and luxurious person like you

289
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,840
You don't look like a mother of a lion.

290
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,590
You're more like a dog's mom.

291
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,870
A dog.
Just kidding.

292
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,750
You call me a dog?
Just kidding.

293
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,710
A dog or something?
Are you still eating?

294
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,980
You're the one who's floating.

295
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,790
You call me a dog. You're so sweet. You deserve it.

296
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,990
Cough.

297
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,750
He's cursing again.

298
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,870
Is this Wa?

299
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,150
I saw your daughter at the restaurant.

300
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,780
I was wondering who she was at first. I saw her going with a woman.

301
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,670
They were so cheesy.

302
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,950
They even kissed each other's cheeks in the middle of the restaurant.

303
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,110
So I washed the photos for you.

304
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,390
This isn't Wa
Of course it is.

305
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,670
This face.

306
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,870
Look at that face It must be

307
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,870
No way.

308
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,110
Wa would never do such a thing.

309
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,390
Of course.

310
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,830
Even so, we're just going with close friends. What's so strange about it?

311
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,030
They kissed on their cheeks. They're just friends.

312
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,670
But they even wore a necklace for each other.

313
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,670
What's wrong with buying gifts for each other?

314
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,710
Don't talk nonsense when you're old.

315
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,630
Wa is getting married next month.

316
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,190
Maybe Wa went to buy something for her wedding.

317
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,350
That's all.

318
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,070
It must be her.

319
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,030
Why didn't you pick up?

320
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,590
Why didn't you answer my call?

321
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,630
I've read the contract you sent. No problem.

322
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,110
Ask them to sign it.

323
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,590
I'll take care of it when I get back.

324
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,630
Thank you so much.

325
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,150
Work?

326
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,550
Oh, yes.

327
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,230
I haven't had a long vacation like this for a long time.

328
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,710
It's okay.

329
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,790
Because

330
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,110
you have other work to do.

331
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,110
Other work?

332
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,950
Don't stretch your head out. It's dangerous.

333
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,030
But it's windy, Mr. Lom.

334
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:16,270
Drive safely. Or I'll ask Sun to take your stuff.

335
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,030
Trust me. I'm better.

336
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,630
I'm stronger and I can get more things.

337
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,990
More importantly,

338
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,670
I drive much better than Sun.

339
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,030
Indeed.

340
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,230
Too bad the flowers are withered now

341
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:02,390
Normally if it hasn't withered There are all kinds of flowers beside the road

342
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,500
You can come again.

343
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,030
Why me?

344
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,230
Is that why you want me to go shopping?

345
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,300
Or we won't have a chance to talk.

346
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,230
Yes.

347
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,510
Your family is good at interrupting others. I'm scared.

348
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,230
I think I've been here before.

349
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,990
I came here with my family when I was young.

350
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,710
My story.

351
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,990
There's nothing fun about it, Mr. Nuea.

352
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,150
When I was young, I knew I was not interested in girls.

353
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,830
I knew it too, but I can't tell others.

354
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,940
My family is traditional.

355
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,550
I hid everything in my heart and didn't want to say it.

356
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,030
When I was 15,

357
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,950
My family went to Europe with Wa's family.

358
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,790
We saw two women kissing on the street.

359
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,790
I want to talk to her.

360
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,070
I want to know how she did it.

361
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,190
I want to release it like them.

362
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,430
But Wa's mom and I...

363
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,590
You can probably imagine

364
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,870
two people with traditional ideas think gay is wrong.

365
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,990
That's when I realized that it wasn't just me.

366
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,780
Yiwa.

367
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,870
Wa cried that day.

368
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,110
No one knows why.

369
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,790
I asked her if it was noon.

370
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,790
She asked me

371
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,950
if the kiss was wrong.

372
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,470
I said no.

373
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,550
It's like two men kissing.

374
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,910
It's not wrong

375
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,990
That night, a 15-year-old boy cried with a 13-year-old girl.

376
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,750
They kept each other's secrets until now.

377
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,470
As for why it was you, I don't know about Nuea either.

378
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,310
All I know is

379
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,350
I smile every time I see you.

380
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,510
When you're happy eating,

381
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,150
when you're angry.

382
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,910
I really want to know

383
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,150
what can make you happy and laugh

384
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,430
and make you happy.

385
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,070
I want to do everything.

386
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,380
Just looking at you makes me feel I can be myself.

387
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,570
I only know

388
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,200
it must be you.

389
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

390
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,530
You should say three words now.

391
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,200
I love you.

392
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,750
I love you too.

393
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,310
Hey, it's so hot. Why did you bring me up?

394
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,590
Why are you complaining? We're almost there. A little more.

395
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,070
There are people interrupting us outside.

396
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,910
I won't let anyone interrupt us again.

397
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,350
Do you think I'll do it?

398
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,430
I want to go home.

399
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,060
Let's go.

400
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,270
Hurry.

401
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,110
You didn't know me last time.

402
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,670
This time, teach me how to meet you.

403
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,990
Are you usually this impatient?

404
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,670
Don't you know? I've never seen you before. I want to kiss your muscles.

405
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,120
Don't waste your energy.

406
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,920
Want to bet?

407
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,770
Let's see who loses strength first.

408
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,160
Do you know me better?

409
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,170
You're worse than I thought.

410
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,640
You don't like it?

411
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,280
I like it.

412
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,460
Nuea.

413
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,020
Again?

414
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,470
Yes.

415
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,430
You only called me Nuea again. In Thailand, there are nicknames in the back. Unless they're close.

416
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,110
Are you curious?

417
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:47,510
Since our first relationship, I'll call you Nuea.

418
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,590
Because it makes me feel

419
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,390
We are closer.

420
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,510
Right?

421
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,550
Then I'll call you Brother Lom.

422
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,340
Bro Lom.

423
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,110
I understand why Wa asked Rine to call her sister.

424
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,909
You can keep calling me that.

425
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,330
No!

426
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,389
Why?

427
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:30,070
Because I have to go back and plan your wedding.

428
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,350
People will find out later.

429
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,830
You mean

430
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,790
Why do you look like that?

431
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,820
You mean

432
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,750
let me be a part of your secret?

433
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,550
Can I?

434
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,700
It's okay.

435
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,780
From now on,

436
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,980
I'll be on your side.

437
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,470
Okay?

438
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,830
I love you, Nuea.

439
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,870
I love you.

440
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,380
Coming.

441
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,300
Don't bother my daughter again.

442
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,950
Mom.

443
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,460
Who's your mom?

444
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,670
When did I allow you to call me mom?

445
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,510
It's all because of you.

446
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,070
My daughter is not like that.

447
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,340
Ever since I met you, I don't know what happened to Yiwaa.

448
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,910
What is it?

449
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,710
Women hug and kiss each other.

450
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,590
Don't make me say such harsh things, okay?

451
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,190
I didn't make Wa change anything.

452
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,220
You know Wa.

453
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,630
You don't know how painful Wa is.

454
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,380
You have a sharp tongue.

455
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,350
Me? I don't know my daughter.

456
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:19,030
I know my daughter best.

457
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,670
But now, Yiwaa is lost.

458
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,100
I know my daughter best.

459
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,350
Is it appropriate?

460
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,990
What do you think is suitable?

461
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,910
You don’t think so?

462
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,830
Lom has everything.

463
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:41,420
looks, status, education and family background.

464
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,910
Most importantly, Lom is a man.

465
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,830
Unlike you.

466
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,750
Did you make your daughter happy?

467
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,470
Have you ever made your daughter happy?

468
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,390
How dare you talk back to me?

469
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,990
Break up with her.
No.

470
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,870
I won't break up with Wa.

471
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,470
How dare you?

472
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,940
Hey, how dare you close the door in front of me?

473
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,910
Remember that.

474
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,510
Yiwaa will marry Lom no matter what.

475
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,990
Remember, do you hear me?

476
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,110
Why did you kiss me?

477
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,710
Do you remember? Since the first day we kissed,

478
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,990
my love only belongs to you.

479
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,110
And it's always like this.

480
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,060
Your mom wants us to break up.

481
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,630
No way.

482
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,910
I won't.

483
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,670
Don't abandon me, Rine.

484
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,030
We have to break up no matter what.

485
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,510
No.

486
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,230
Please don't do that.

487
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,420
She's your mother.

488
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,740
You can't let her go.

489
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,550
But you can give up me.

490
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,110
No.

491
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,950
No, Rine.

492
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,070
Don't do this.

493
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,870
You're my love

494
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,750
I said I can't let you go.

495
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,270
I don't want you to fight with Mom.

496
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,870
Because this is something you've been trying to hide from her.

497
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,630
I don't want you and your mom

498
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,510
because of me.

499
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,870
Let's get out of here.

500
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,430
Leave this place where everyone criticizes us.

501
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,790
To a place where everyone can accept us.

502
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,750
where everyone can accept us.

503
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,270
Let's go together, Rine.

504
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,430
What about your mom and your family?

505
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,950
They will always be important to me.

506
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,710
But you are the most important.

507
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,070
Will you come with me?

508
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,790
Can I be by your side?

509
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,740
I don't want to let you go.

510
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,700
Have a safe trip, son.

511
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,950
Come home whenever you have time.

512
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,550
Mom, will you go to Bangkok with me?

513
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,950
Who will take care of your dad?

514
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,990
We can go together.

515
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,550
Please take care of him.

516
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,950
You may have a hard future,

517
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,710
but if you can't hold on any longer,

518
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,100
go home, kid.

519
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,150
If my family is willing to accept me, That’s good.

520
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,980
You will have a new family. This family will accept you.

521
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,780
Thank you, mom.

522
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,670
Ryu has something to tell him.

523
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,070
Tell him. Tell him. Hurry.

524
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,180
Do you want to die? I can tell him myself.

525
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,460
I don't know.

526
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,550
Take care of Nuea. When will Nuea cry? I'll find you.

527
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,070
See you in Bangkok.

528
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,620
We'll go back to Bangkok when school starts.

529
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,510
Don't forget to buy us dinner then.

530
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,030
I'll always be on your side, okay?

531
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,190
Sure. Call me when you're free.

532
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,150
Yes, I will.

533
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,750
Bye.

534
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,030
Bye.
Here we go.

535
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,110
Bye.

536
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,550
Bye, Nuea.

537
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:55,830
[Three weeks later]

538
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,910
Okay, you're cool.

539
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,830
Nuea.

540
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,070
Don't say sorry, Mr. Lom.

541
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,310
I may be a little upset. I don't want to see my boyfriend get married.

542
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,190
But I understand.

543
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,270
So don't say it or I'll get mad.

544
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,460
I don't want to get married.

545
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,150
No, you have to.

546
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:45,910
Do you know how hard I worked How much effort did you put into it?

547
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,710
Last night, I was on the stage all night.

548
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,630
I designed your wedding cake and champagne tart layout.

549
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,190
and flowers.

550
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,350
I almost went in and stood with the organizer.

551
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,750
You have to get married no matter what.

552
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,460
Because I've done the most for this wedding.

553
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,070
Can't we run away together?

554
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,470
No.

555
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,710
I love this job more than giving up on them. Love this company.

556
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:27,750
So as the groom, You have to do your best.

557
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:30,900
I feel wronged.

558
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,830
Whose boyfriend is more tolerant than my boyfriend?

559
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,350
Why do you care?

560
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,780
It was me

561
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,190
It's me.

562
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:50,890
Hey.

563
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,230
This isn't the time to be lovey-dovey.

564
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,000
Hey, Nuea. The bride is gone.

565
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,590
What?

566
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,870
Why are you sighing

567
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,630
You won't answer.

568
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:42,630
My mom told me if you keep sighing, you'll die of asthma.

569
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,470
It's not true.

570
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,630
Your happiness will disappear too.

571
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,950
Here.

572
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,950
You'll have a lot of happiness.

573
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,820
Nuea, you can go now. Let's go home together.

574
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,230
I have to go. Bye.

575
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,190
What's wrong with me?

576
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,150
I'm going to see Wa.

577
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,820
[In the next episode]

578
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,150
I searched the whole hotel, but I couldn't find it.

579
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,710
I asked someone to check Yiwaa's room. I saw this letter.

580
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,630
Wa would never do such a thing. No, no.

581
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,030
We both know that.

582
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,150
This naughty guy must think that if he told me in advance, I will stop her.

583
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:02,350
The condition Yiwa made will be the best.

584
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,990
You and your daughter have been deceiving me and Lom.

585
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,380
Have you used your brain?

586
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,360
Just say it. There's no wedding today.
